## Workflows

### Primary (run on every push + PR)

Each file maps to one row in the README badge table.

| File | README row | What it covers |
|------|------------|----------------|
| `workflows/unit-tests.yml` | Unit Tests | three dynamically balanced pytest shards with a stable combined-coverage gate (exact 100% line + branch floor), explicit offline accelerator catalog/NodePool/watch-list/instance-pool validation, BATS, CLI smoke, autopilot smoke (both-engine dry-run/config validation + exact pinned Claude Code and Codex installs), CDK synth + config matrix, lockfile freshness, fresh install, MCP install + launch smoke, workload import checks |
| `workflows/inference-streaming-proxy.yml` | — | Native Node.js 24 tests for the production streaming Lambda, with exact 100% line/function/branch thresholds |
| `workflows/floci-tests.yml` | Floci Tests | Emulated-AWS integration + E2E layer against a digest-pinned [Floci](https://github.com/floci-io/floci) service container with zero AWS credentials: wire-level DynamoDB/SQS/S3/Secrets Manager/CloudFormation behavior through unmodified production classes, harness inventory scanners, and the live-validation preflight+baseline E2E via `gco release validate --emulator-endpoint` (see `docs/FLOCI_TESTING.md`) |
| `workflows/integration-tests.yml` | Integration Tests | Autopilot boot probes for both engines (`gco autopilot` on a bare runner self-installs the pinned Claude Code — and, in the codex twin, the pinned Codex — pre-warms and boots the in-tree gco MCP server plus every curated companion under the engine, and dispatches to Bedrock with the shipped per-engine default model, stopped fail-closed at the credential boundary by fabricated keys — AWS rejecting the signed request is the success condition: 403 under claude, SigV4's 401 under codex, whose probe also asserts the engine delta that codex races MCP init against the first turn instead of blocking on connections), per-Dockerfile build + functional container tests (boot under pod-equivalent constraints, probe/auth-fail-closed/degraded-503 HTTP contracts, kubelet exec-command shapes, SIGTERM shutdown, moto-SQS consume/reject exit codes for the queue processor), dev-container smoke (pinned toolchain incl. uv/uvx, native-arch binaries, both engine plans/configs, and Codex's persisted lazy install across disposable containers), kind E2E with Calico and pinned Metrics Server (NetworkPolicy enforcement, RBAC verification, ResourceQuota/LimitRange, PDB validation, inference-proxy HPA `ScalingActive`, cross-namespace traffic blocking, all 5 service deployments), kind examples smoke (Calico-enforced, pinned kubeflow-trainer + mlflow charts installed with the exact `charts.yaml` values via `validate_helm_charts.py --emit-ref/--emit-values`, ServiceMonitor CRD from the pinned kube-prometheus-stack, the post-Helm mlflow NetworkPolicies applied with the deployment token filled from kind's own node CIDR so the kubelet-probe allow is exercised for real — the chart's policy admits only pod sources and silently drops probes, which is invisible under kindnet, the real `examples/kubeflow-trainjob.yaml` applied as the manifest-processor ServiceAccount and run to `Complete` with the all-reduce sentinel verified, a `SubjectAccessReview` (SAR) sweep derived from the submission allowlist — SAR is the `authorization.k8s.io` object that answers "may this user *verb* this resource?", posted as an explicit body rather than through `kubectl auth can-i`, because can-i resolves its resource argument via discovery and answers "no" for a CRD kind whose chart is not installed yet, and mlflow host-validation probes — allowed Host 200 / arbitrary Host 403 / `/health` exempt), K8s manifest schema validation (kubeconform), Lambda import validation, cross-module pytest, MCP server pytest |
| `workflows/security.yml` | Security | bandit, pip-audit, npm audit across every owned package graph, trivy (filesystem + per-image matrix), trufflehog, gitleaks, semgrep, checkov, KICS, CodeQL (Python + JavaScript) |
| `workflows/lint.yml` | Linting | actionlint, action SHA-pin verification (including each version comment resolved against GitHub), hadolint, markdownlint, strict MkDocs wiki build (the same build `pages.yml` runs at deploy time, so wiki breakage fails pre-merge), mypy (strict / stacks / lambda), ruff (format + check, imports included), strict ShellCheck at `style` severity over every tracked `*.sh` path (NUL-safe, external sources enabled, empty inventory fails), yamllint |

### Satellites

Workflows outside the four badged gates. Most are schedule- or dispatch-driven; `mooncake-image.yml` also runs on push and PR but is a narrow, feature-specific contract test rather than a headline gate.

| File | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `workflows/release.yml` | `workflow_dispatch` | Release stage 1: bump the version files on a `release/vX.Y.Z` branch, open the release PR, and dispatch the PR-gating CI workflows against that branch so its required checks report (pushes/PRs made with `GITHUB_TOKEN` never trigger `push:`/`pull_request:` runs; `workflow_dispatch` is the documented exception). Never writes to `main`, so it works under full branch protection. Uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no PAT required |
| `workflows/release-publish.yml` | `push`: `main` (paths: `VERSION`) + manual | Release stage 2: after the release PR squash-merges, verify all three version mirrors agree, create the annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag on the merge commit, and create the GitHub Release with auto-generated notes. Idempotent end to end (a partial failure is completed by re-dispatching), refuses to move an existing v-tag, and only auto-publishes push events whose commit subject is `Release vX.Y.Z` — a stray VERSION edit never becomes a release |
| `workflows/deps-scan.yml` | `cron: 0 9 1 * *` (monthly, UTC) + manual | Check pinned dependency versions, deterministic accelerator/NodePool/watch-list policy, and live EC2 accelerator-catalog drift; open or refresh one rolling issue when drift is found, then comment and close it after a complete clean scan with no skipped checks |
| `workflows/cve-scan.yml` | `cron: 0 9 * * 1` (Mondays, UTC) + manual | Re-run trivy against current CVE databases |
| `workflows/pages.yml` | `workflow_run` after **Unit Tests** completes on `main` | Publish the project site to GitHub Pages via `actions/deploy-pages`: build the MkDocs orientation wiki (`wiki/` + `mkdocs.yml`, strict mode) from the triggering run's commit at the site root, download that run's `pytest-coverage` artifact and serve `htmlcov/` at `/coverage/`, and regenerate the shields.io badge JSON at the site root (so the README badge's percent-encoded URL never changes). Split out of `unit-tests.yml` so a GitHub Pages backend stall — or a wiki build failure — surfaces here instead of failing the test gate; the PR-side `lint:mkdocs:strict` job runs the identical build pre-merge |
| `workflows/mooncake-image.yml` | `push`: `main`, PR, manual | Pull the upstream Mooncake vLLM image pinned in `cli/images.py` (`_DISAGGREGATED_DEFAULT_IMAGE`) and run `tests/test_mooncake_image_contract.py`: prefill-decode proxy health under the image's `python3`, `MooncakeStoreConfig` acceptance of the rendered store config, and KV-connector name registration. Deliberately not Trivy/CVE-scanned — the image is upstream and unpatchable; version drift is surfaced by `deps-scan` |
| `workflows/pr-type-label.yml` | PR opened/edited/reopened/ready (drafts included) | Sync the declared type-of-change checkbox to the corresponding release-note label without using `pull_request_target` or interpolating untrusted body text into shell; fork PRs are skipped for maintainer labelling |
| `workflows/grafana-dashboards.yml` | Paths-filtered `push`/PR + manual | Resolve the Grafana image from the pinned kube-prometheus-stack chart, provision every curated dashboard ConfigMap into the real image, and require each uid to load without provisioning errors |

### Naming conventions

- **Display names:** colon-delimited `category:tool:test_name`, for example `unit:pytest:core`, `security:trivy:container-scan`, `lint:mypy:stacks`.
- **Job IDs:** hyphen-delimited (GitHub Actions requires `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`), for example `unit-pytest-core`, `security-trivy-container-scan`.
- **Click target for every badge:** the workflow file on the Actions tab, not a per-job deep link. GitHub's per-job URL scheme is inconsistent; the Actions tab surfaces every job of a workflow in one view.

### Draft pull requests

Every job in a PR-triggered workflow is gated on `github.event.pull_request.draft == false`, so a draft PR starts nothing. GitHub has no workflow-level `if:`, which is why the clause is repeated per job rather than declared once — and why one ungated job is enough to keep spending runner capacity.

Two details make that safe rather than lossy:

- `ready_for_review` is in every PR workflow's trigger `types`, so the full suite fires the moment a PR leaves draft. Without it a PR could reach a mergeable state having never run CI.
- Declaring `types` at all **replaces** the default `[opened, synchronize, reopened]`, so those three are restated explicitly. Dropping `synchronize` would silently stop CI on pushes to an open PR while opened/reopened kept working.

`unit:pytest:core` composes the draft clause with its `always()` schedule. That is the only permitted narrowing of the stable required check: a draft PR cannot merge, and marking it ready re-runs the workflow with the clause true, so every mergeable state still yields a real aggregate result instead of a skip standing in for a pass.

`pr-type-label.yml` is the one deliberate exemption — one short job, and the type label drives release-note grouping and review routing, both worth having correct while a PR is still a draft. `tests/test_workflow_draft_pr_gating_contract.py` pins the gate, the trigger types, the concurrency defaults, and that exemption.

### Cross-cutting defaults

All CI workflows share the same safety defaults:

- `concurrency.group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}` with `cancel-in-progress: true` so rapid pushes on the same branch supersede in-flight runs. Explicitly **off** for the release pair — `release.yml` and `release-publish.yml` share one repository-wide `group: release` with `cancel-in-progress: false`, so releases serialize across both stages and a half-run release is never cancelled mid-flight. `pages.yml` is the other exception: it uses a dedicated `concurrency.group: pages` with `cancel-in-progress: false` so a real Pages deployment is never cancelled mid-flight. The scheduled scans (`cve-scan.yml`, `deps-scan.yml`) keep the standard per-ref group but also set `cancel-in-progress: false` — a scan in flight is never worth cancelling, and scoping the group by ref keeps two manual `workflow_dispatch` runs on different branches from serializing behind each other.
- `timeout-minutes` on every job (10 min for lint, 15 for unit, 20–30 for integration).
- `permissions:` scoped narrowly. All CI workflows run with `contents: read`. `release.yml` grants `contents: write` (push the release branch), `pull-requests: write` (open the release PR; also requires the repository Actions setting "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"), and `actions: write` (dispatch the PR-gating workflows). `release-publish.yml` grants `contents: write` for the tag push and Release creation. `pages.yml`'s deploy job grants `pages: write` + `id-token: write` (to publish to Pages) and `actions: read` (to pull the `pytest-coverage` artifact from the triggering Unit Tests run).
- Caching: `actions/setup-python` with `cache: pip` and `cache-dependency-path: requirements-lock.txt`. Mypy jobs add an explicit `actions/cache` on `.mypy_cache/`.
- AWS-backed dependency discovery uses OIDC via `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` — never long-lived access keys. The monthly scan uses the role for EKS, RDS, EMR, Bedrock, and EC2 accelerator-catalog reads; deterministic accelerator policy validation remains offline.

### Action pinning

Every third-party action is pinned to a **40-character commit SHA** with its tag
kept as a trailing comment:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1  # v7.0.1
```

A tag — even a patch tag like `v7.0.1` — is a mutable pointer. The action's
publisher, or anyone who takes over their account, can move it onto code that
reads this repository's secrets and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` of whichever job runs it,
retroactively and with no diff here. A commit SHA is the only ref that cannot be
repointed. The trailing comment is what keeps the pin maintainable: Dependabot
recognizes the `@<sha>  # <tag>` shape and rewrites both halves when it bumps an
action, so version drift stays visible in review instead of hiding inside forty
opaque characters.

Local composite refs (`uses: ./.github/actions/<name>`) are deliberately
unpinned — they resolve inside the checked-out commit, so they are already as
fixed as the workflow calling them.

Resolve a tag to its SHA with:

```bash
gh api repos/actions/checkout/commits/v7.0.1 --jq '.sha'
```

#### What CI enforces

The rules live in [`scripts/verify_action_pins.py`](scripts/verify_action_pins.py)
so the PR-time pytest contract and the CI job cannot disagree about what
"pinned" means. Three layers, over every workflow **and** every composite
action:

| Layer | Checks | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|
| Format | Ref is a 40-hex commit SHA; comment is an exact `vX.Y.Z` | `unit:pytest:core` + `lint:actions:pinning` |
| Agreement | Every reference to one action resolves to one commit and claims one version | same |
| Truth | The tag in the comment really points at the pinned SHA on GitHub | `lint:actions:pinning` only (needs network) |

The comment must be an exact three-part version. A bare `# v7` is
*unfalsifiable* — nobody, human or machine, can tell which release the hash is
supposed to be, so the truth layer would have nothing to check.

Agreement is keyed per **repository**, not per action path, because
`github/codeql-action/init` and `github/codeql-action/analyze` are one
repository at one commit; two SHAs there would mean two builds of the same
action in one pipeline.

Truth is what makes the comment more than a claim: `lint:actions:pinning`
resolves each `# vX.Y.Z` through `api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{tag}`
— the same endpoint the pins were generated from — and fails when the tag points
somewhere else. That catches a mistyped or copy-pasted comment *and* a tag the
publisher has since moved. One request per repository (~15 total), authenticated
with `github.token`. A lookup that cannot be completed (rate limit, timeout,
deleted tag) is reported without failing the job: an api.github.com blip must
not block unrelated pull requests, or people learn to ignore the check.

One wrinkle worth knowing about: an organization can block the GitHub Actions
app, and then a workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` gets 403 on that org's *public*
repositories while an anonymous request to the same URL returns 200
(`aquasecurity/setup-trivy` behaves this way). A refused token therefore falls
back to an unauthenticated read, so the pin is really verified instead of
quietly landing in the tolerated "incomplete" bucket.

The contract also asserts [Dependabot](#dependabot) is configured to see these
pins, since a pin nothing bumps is a pin that rots.

Run it locally:

```bash
python .github/scripts/verify_action_pins.py                    # format + agreement
GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) \
  python .github/scripts/verify_action_pins.py --verify-upstream  # + resolve every tag
```

Because the finding is now structurally impossible, semgrep's
`github-actions-mutable-action-tag` suppression was removed from
`.github/config/semgrep-excluded-rules.txt`; that file is intentionally empty.

### Single-source pins

Every version CI installs is declared in exactly one place; jobs read that place instead of carrying copies, so a bump edits one file. Where each pin lives:

| Pin | Single source | How jobs consume it | Reintroduction guard |
|-----|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Python (all CI jobs) | `.python-version` at the repo root | `actions/setup-python` with `python-version-file: ".python-version"` on every job (same pattern as `.nvmrc` for Node) | — (a literal `python-version:` would be caught in review; the deps-scan python-consistency check compares CI against the Lambda runtime) |
| Node / npm | `.nvmrc` / `packageManager` in `package.json` | `node-version-file` + `.github/scripts/use-pinned-npm.sh` | deps-scan Node/npm consistency section |
| Trivy | `version` input **default** of `.github/actions/install-trivy/action.yml` | callers pass no `version:` | deps-scan reads the default via `extract_install_trivy_pin`; a workflow-level `TRIVY_VERSION` no longer exists |
| kind binary + node image, Calico version + sha | workflow-level `env` block of `integration-tests.yml` (`KIND_VERSION`, `KIND_NODE_IMAGE`, `CALICO_VERSION`, `CALICO_SHA256`) | run-blocks interpolate `${CALICO_*}` directly; `helm/kind-action` steps use `${{ env.* }}` | `test_repeated_workflow_pins_agree_across_jobs` requires the workflow-level declarations and rejects job-level shadows; `extract_kind_pins` resolves the env references for the drift scan |
| Helm + kubectl (version and sha256) | the authenticated `RUN` lines of `lambda/helm-installer/Dockerfile` — the binaries production actually ships | a "Derive … pins" step sources `lib_dependency_scan.sh` and loads `extract_helm_installer_pins` output into `GITHUB_ENV` (`integration-tests.yml` ×2, `deps-scan.yml`) | `test_helm_and_kubectl_pins_live_only_in_the_installer_dockerfile` bans literal `HELM_*`/`KUBECTL_*` declarations in workflows; the deps-scan consistency section reports a reintroduced copy and still cross-checks `Dockerfile.dev`'s kubectl |
| Python packages CI needs at runtime | `pyproject.toml` — jobs install the project, never a named distribution | `pip install -e .` (base deps, e.g. PyYAML for the Grafana dashboard validator), `pip install -e ".[extra]"`, or `pip install -r requirements-lock.txt` + `pip install -e . --no-deps` for the reproducibility-critical jobs. `integration:docker:queue-processor` needs a real SQS wire API and installs nothing at all: it reuses the digest-pinned Floci service container that `floci-tests.yml` already runs | `test_workflows_never_pip_install_a_package_pyproject_declares` fails on any workflow step that pip-installs a distribution `pyproject.toml` declares — in any form, including a bare name or an interpolated version. This drifted for real: a `moto[server]==5.2.2` pin sat against a lock constraining 5.2.3, so pip refused to resolve at all; deriving the version would have fixed the symptom and kept the second copy, so the packages are not named. Targets that are not declared distributions stay legal (`pip==25.0.1`, `uv`, lock-derived `"$pin"`), and `deps-scan.yml` is exempt because resolving against *latest* is its purpose |
| Floci emulator image (tag + digest) | one `floci/floci:<tag>@sha256:<digest>` value, shared by every workflow that runs it | `services.floci.image` in `floci-tests.yml` (emulator-backed test layer) and `integration-tests.yml` (the queue-processor job's SQS endpoint). GitHub does not expand `env` inside `services.*.image`, so the string is repeated and reconciled by test instead | `tests/test_pinned_floci_version.py` discovers every workflow referencing the image rather than naming them, requires all pins identical in both tag and digest, rejects any unpinned or off-pin reference, and holds `docs/FLOCI_TESTING.md`'s local-run tag to the same value |
| Claude Code/Codex pins, per-engine default Bedrock models, companion MCP registry | `cli/autopilot.py` / `gco.bedrock` (production modules) | `.github/scripts/autopilot_ci_contract.py` derives facts and centralizes assertions for `unit:cli:autopilot`, the dev-container step, and both engines' boot probes | `tests/test_autopilot_ci_contract.py` holds the dual-engine contract in lockstep with production |

Single-job pins (`KUBECONFORM_*`, `METRICS_SERVER_*`, `ACTIONLINT_*`) stay declared in the one job that installs them — there is no second copy to drift, and the declaration-next-to-download shape keeps the checksum-binding tests simple.

## Live release validation stays local

Live release validation is intentionally outside GitHub Actions. No file under `workflows/` may invoke `scripts.live_release_validation`, upload its reports, or upload `checkpoint.json`; the offline guard contracts scan every YAML workflow for those regressions. A developer runs the harness locally only after explicit authorization and posts a sanitized summary comment (run ID, exact SHA, overall status, per-action statuses) on the pull request; the full reports enumerate the validation account's ID, ARNs, and endpoint URLs and stay on the operator's machine. Ordinary CI remains mocked/offline and never receives the checkpoint, which carries resumable destructive authority.

A full local run is normally required for changes to deployed CDK/CloudFormation lifecycle, deploy/destroy and retained-resource cleanup, IAM/networking/regional routing, EKS/Kubernetes wiring, or deployed service/Lambda integrations that cannot be established offline. It is usually not required for isolated CLI behavior fully covered by fast mocked tests, CI/test-tooling-only changes, dependency bumps with no deployed runtime effect, docs/test-only changes, and behavior-preserving refactors. These are risk-based defaults: a live-resource CLI change or a dependency bump that alters deployed behavior can still require a run. Record the decision in the pull request and follow [`docs/LIVE_RELEASE_VALIDATION.md`](../docs/LIVE_RELEASE_VALIDATION.md) when required.

## Composite actions

Shared logic used by multiple jobs. Invoked with `uses: ./.github/actions/<name>`.

- **`actions/build-lambda-package`** — stages `lambda/kubectl-applier-simple-build/`, `lambda/helm-installer-build/`, and the production-only `lambda/inference-streaming-proxy-build/` graph that CDK synth, pytest, and KICS scans expect. Callers must configure Python 3.14 and Node.js from `.nvmrc`; the action installs and verifies the exact npm version from the Lambda `packageManager` pin before its locked install. Used by `unit:cdk:synth`, `unit:cdk:config-matrix`, `unit:cdk:nag-compliance`, `unit:pytest:core`, and `security:kics:iac`.

## Sharded unit tests

The core pytest suite is split across parallel jobs. `unit:pytest:core (shard N/M)`
runs one slice; `unit:pytest:core` then combines every slice's coverage and
enforces the floor. Keeping the combining job's display name means an existing
required-status-check rule for `unit:pytest:core` still applies, and it still
means "the whole core suite passed and coverage is at or above the floor".

The split is computed at run time by
[`scripts/split_tests.py`](../scripts/split_tests.py), which asks pytest for the
test count of every file and greedily bin-packs files into equally weighted
shards. Nothing about the partition is checked in, so it cannot drift as tests
are added, renamed, or deleted.

**To change the shard count, edit `matrix.shard` in `unit-pytest-core-shard` and
nothing else.** Adding `3` to the list yields three shards: `--of` comes from
`strategy.job-total`, and the combining job discovers shard artifacts by glob, so
both adapt automatically. `tests/test_split_tests.py` fails if that contract is
broken — for instance if the shard total were hardcoded a second time, which
would keep splitting the suite in two while a third of the tests silently stopped
running.

Two details worth knowing before editing these jobs:

- Each shard passes `--cov-fail-under=0`. This is load-bearing, not redundant:
  pytest-cov reads `fail_under` from `[tool.coverage.report]` and applies it even
  when `--cov-report=` suppresses all reports, so without it every shard fails
  for covering only its own slice.
- The combining job writes `coverage xml/json/html` *before* `coverage report`,
  each with `--fail-under=0`, so a coverage regression still publishes a report
  and the Pages badge input. The final `coverage report` applies the real floor
  and decides the job result.

## CodeQL config

[`codeql/codeql-config.yml`](codeql/codeql-config.yml) is read by the Advanced Setup Python and JavaScript CodeQL jobs in [`workflows/security.yml`](workflows/security.yml), via the `config-file:` input on `github/codeql-action/init`. It does three things:

- **Scopes the scan** to hand-authored Python and JavaScript runtime code (`gco/`, `cli/`, `gco_mcp/`, `lambda/`, `scripts/`). Generated output (`cdk.out/`, `lambda/*-build/`), virtualenvs, caches, tests, and the demo folder are excluded. The deployable `lambda/inference-streaming-proxy/index.mjs` remains in scope while its tests and staged build copy are excluded.
- **Pins the query pack** to `security-and-quality` so the additional maintainability queries still surface alongside the default security suite.
- **Filters two rules** that have been reviewed and classified as false positives against this codebase: `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data` (we log operational identifiers like ARNs and registry hostnames, not credential values) and `py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization` (only ever hit by test-file assertions, not access-control code paths). Each exclusion carries an inline comment in the config naming the exact call sites and the reason — audit them when the codebase shape changes.

The scan runs as an Advanced Setup workflow rather than Default Setup so the filters and paths are pinned in git instead of hidden in repo Settings. To swap back to Default Setup: comment out the `security-codeql-python-code-analysis` job in `workflows/security.yml` and re-enable Default Setup in repo Settings → Code security → CodeQL. The config file has no effect under Default Setup.

## README badges

The README's badge row has three parts, in order — five dynamic health
signals, then a navigation link:

1. **Four workflow-status badges** (`Unit Tests`, `Integration Tests`, `Security`, `Linting`) from GitHub's native `badge.svg` endpoint.
2. **A coverage badge** rendered by shields.io from the endpoint JSON that `pages.yml` publishes at the Pages site root (`/coverage-badge.json`), generated from the same run whose HTML report is served at `/coverage/` — the badge links there. Badge, report, and the exact 100% gate all describe one run.
3. **A wiki badge** — a static shields.io badge linking to the Pages site root, where `pages.yml` serves the MkDocs wiki. It sits last so the dynamic quality signals stay grouped.

### "repo or workflow not found" on fresh or private repositories

The four workflow-status badges at the top of the README come from GitHub's native `badge.svg` endpoint and render a placeholder image when the repo is unreachable. The wiki badge (`img.shields.io/badge/...`) is static and always renders; the coverage badge (`img.shields.io/endpoint`) renders whatever `/coverage-badge.json` the Pages site last published, so it needs one successful `pages.yml` deploy before it shows a number.

If a stale run ever shows a `img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/...` URL rendering as **"repo or workflow not found"**, the usual cause is the repo being private (shields.io hits the public GitHub REST API and gets a 404). Making the repo public resolves it; there's no code change needed.

## Issue & PR templates

- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` — structured bug report with environment, repro steps, expected vs. actual.
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` — problem/solution/alternatives framing.
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` — links out to the docs (TROUBLESHOOTING.md, QUICKSTART.md) so users who arrive here with a support question are routed there first.
- `pull_request_template.md` — summary, reviewer-facing type-of-change checkboxes, release-label guidance (generated notes are categorized by PR labels from `release.yml`), testing checklist.

## CODEOWNERS

[`CODEOWNERS`](CODEOWNERS) lists path-based review owners. Reviews are requested automatically when matched paths change. Make it mandatory by enabling "Require review from Code Owners" in branch protection.

## Dependabot

[`dependabot.yml`](dependabot.yml) covers **GitHub Actions, Docker, and both repository-owned npm graphs**, not Python.

Rationale: Python deps are pinned through `requirements-lock.txt` with `pip-compile` and reviewed intentionally; Dependabot would fight that workflow. CVE-driven Python bumps are caught by the weekly `cve-scan` workflow (Trivy) and the monthly `deps-scan` workflow.

Ecosystems tracked:

- GitHub Actions, in **two** blocks: `directory: "/"` for `.github/workflows`, plus `directories: ["/.github/actions/*"]` for the composite actions. The second block is not redundant — for this ecosystem `/` scans `.github/workflows` and an `action.yml` at the *repository root* only, so without it the third-party refs inside `.github/actions/*/action.yml` would never be bumped. Only the plural `directories` key supports the `*` wildcard, and the two directory sets must not overlap. Since every ref is a commit SHA ([Action pinning](#action-pinning)), this is what keeps the pins current rather than frozen; `tests/test_workflow_security_contract.py` fails if a composite action pins something Dependabot cannot see.
- npm root tooling (`/`) and the deployable streaming Lambda (`/lambda/inference-streaming-proxy`)
- Docker (`dockerfiles/`, `lambda/helm-installer/`, `Dockerfile.dev` at repo root)

## Helper scripts

- **`scripts/use-pinned-npm.sh`** — installs (when necessary) and verifies the exact npm release declared by a supplied `package.json` `packageManager` field. Every CI path that invokes npm calls this helper first; the Lambda packaging composite also enforces it internally.
- **`scripts/dependency-scan.sh`** — backs the `deps-scan` workflow. See [below](#dependency-scan-script) for the full reference.
- **`scripts/check_pip_audit_ignore.py`** — backs the `security:pip-audit:deps` job. See [below](#pip-audit-ignore-validator) for the full reference.

### Dependency-scan script

`scripts/dependency-scan.sh` is the engine behind the monthly `deps-scan` workflow. It detects drift across every dependency surface the project controls and, when run from CI, writes a Markdown report. The workflow opens or refreshes one rolling issue while drift exists, then posts a dated resolution comment and closes that issue only when a later scan reports both no drift and no explicitly skipped checks. The script's `scan_complete` output prevents missing AWS credentials or another recorded skip from being mistaken for a clean result.

#### What it checks

| Surface | Source | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Python packages | `pip list --outdated` against an editable install of the current repo with **every** `[project.optional-dependencies]` group enabled (groups enumerated by `extract_python_extras` in `lib_dependency_scan.sh`), filtered to packages we pin *directly* in `pyproject.toml` | Transitive-only drift is excluded because those versions are controlled by upstream pins (`jsii`, `aws-cdk-lib`, `botocore`, `fastmcp`, …) and bumping them ourselves either no-ops or breaks the resolver. The filter is driven by `extract_direct_python_deps` in `lib_dependency_scan.sh`. Installing all extras closes the gap where pins living *only* in an optional group (`aws-cdk-lib` in `cdk`, `playwright` in `diagrams`, …) were invisible to `pip list --outdated` and so never reached the report. |
| npm packages | Exact direct pins (`dependencies` + `devDependencies`) in every repository-owned `package.json`, enumerated by `list_npm_package_dirs` and parsed by `extract_npm_direct_pins` in `lib_dependency_scan.sh` | Public registry, no AWS creds. Compares each pin against the package's `latest` dist-tag — the npm analogue of the Python-packages surface. Closes the gap where `aws-cdk` and `markdownlint-cli2` drift only surfaced indirectly (Dockerfile ARG, pre-commit rev) and the inference-streaming-proxy's `@aws-sdk` clients surfaced nowhere. Transitives are excluded; lockfiles own those |
| Node/npm package management | Every repository-owned `package.json`, its adjacent lockfile, and `.github/dependabot.yml` | Requires exact direct pins, `packageManager`, a committed lockfile, and a matching Dependabot npm directory. Also checks Node/npm/CDK consistency against `.nvmrc`, `Dockerfile.dev`, and `gco/stacks/constants.py`. |
| Docker image tags | `image: …:<tag>` references in `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `lambda/kubectl-applier-simple/manifests/`, `examples/`, `scripts/live_release_validation/manifests/`, and `lambda/helm-installer/charts.yaml`; the Mooncake default image pinned as `_DISAGGREGATED_DEFAULT_IMAGE` in `cli/images.py`; and the model-sync `AWS_CLI_IMAGE` in `gco/services/inference_monitor.py` | Queries the image's own registry via `skopeo` (with retries); any first path component containing a dot/port is honored as the registry, so new registries need no scanner change. Comparison is **same-variant**: a pin is compared only against tags sharing its exact suffix (`24.01-py3` against `-py3` tags, `3.14.6-slim` against `-slim`, bare semver against bare semver) — moving variants (another CUDA line or base distro) is a human decision, not drift (`newer_same_variant_tag` in `lib_dependency_scan.sh`). The Mooncake image is a Python constant — not a Dockerfile `FROM` or a manifest — so Dependabot doesn't see it; surfacing its drift here is the cue to validate and bump the pin (the `mooncake-image` workflow re-runs the image contract tests against the new tag). The AWS CLI image is additionally bound to its readable tag by hashing the raw multi-architecture registry manifest and comparing it with the committed digest. |
| Helm charts | `lambda/helm-installer/charts.yaml` | Uses `helm show chart` for OCI charts and `helm search repo` for traditional repos |
| EKS add-ons | `addon_name`/`addon_version` pairs extracted from `gco/stacks/constants.py` | Requires AWS credentials (via OIDC). The script pre-flights `sts get-caller-identity`; without valid creds the add-on section is explicitly **skipped** and the report notes why — everything else still runs |
| Accelerator catalog and Karpenter NodePools | `gco/config/accelerator_catalog.json`, NodePool manifests `40`–`46`, `cdk.json` `historical.watch_instance_types`, the `ConfigLoader` fallback, and the `INSTANCE_POOLS` Spot Placement Score pools | Always runs deterministic offline policy validation: rejects deprecated/end-of-life scheduling, reports newer unreferenced generations with exact NodePool guidance, requires both watch lists to equal the catalog, and holds every pool to three-plus watched members with an explicit pooled-or-unpooled decision per watched type. With OIDC, sequential paginated EC2 discovery compares the catalog with all NVIDIA GPU/AWS Neuron types across enabled commercial Regions |
| EKS Kubernetes version | `kubernetes_version` in `cdk.json` | Requires AWS credentials (via OIDC). Compares against the newest minor still in EKS **standard support** (`eks describe-cluster-versions`) and reports the standard-support end date so upgrade urgency is visible. See [Maintenance](../docs/MAINTENANCE.md#upgrading-the-eks-kubernetes-version) for the upgrade steps |
| Aurora PostgreSQL engine | `AURORA_POSTGRES_VERSION` from `gco/stacks/constants.py` (a plain version string applied via `AuroraPostgresEngineVersion.of()`, so a bump never waits for an aws-cdk-lib enum release) | Requires AWS credentials (via OIDC). Queries `rds describe-db-engine-versions` for the latest minor release within the same major line |
| EMR Serverless | `EMR_SERVERLESS_RELEASE_LABEL` from `gco/stacks/constants.py` | Requires AWS credentials (via OIDC). Lists release labels (`emr list-release-labels`) and reports a newer release in the same major line, or a new major line when one exists |
| Bedrock default models | `context.bedrock.mission_default_model_id` (Mission sampling), `context.bedrock.capacity_advisor_default_model_id` (capacity advisor), `context.bedrock.claude_code_default_model_id` (`gco autopilot`'s Claude Code session model), `context.bedrock.codex_default_model_id` (its Codex session model), and `context.bedrock.embedding_model_id` (Mission memory's text-embedding model) from `cdk.json`, each resolved through `gco.bedrock`; plus `context.vector_store.embedding_model_id` (the workload RAG corpus's independent embedding model) | Requires AWS credentials (via OIDC). The generation keys compare against system-defined inference profiles (`bedrock list-inference-profiles`); the embedding keys compare against `bedrock list-foundation-models --by-output-modality EMBEDDING` (both pinned to us-east-1). Drift is reported per key only within the *same model family*. Dependabot does not inspect these deployment configuration values |
| Dockerfile.dev pins | `ARG` pins in `Dockerfile.dev` (Node LTS major, npm, CDK CLI, kubectl, AWS CLI v2, Docker CLI, Buildx, uv) | Public endpoints, no AWS creds. Each ARG resolves against its own upstream (`nodejs/Release`, the npm/CDK registries, `dl.k8s.io`, `aws/aws-cli` tags, `moby/moby`, `docker/buildx`, `astral-sh/uv`) |
| GCO Autopilot pins | `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION`, `CODEX_VERSION`, and `COMPANION_MCP_SERVERS` in `cli/autopilot.py` (via `extract_claude_code_pin` / `extract_codex_pin` / `extract_companion_mcp_packages`) | Public endpoints, no AWS creds. The Claude Code and Codex install pins are each compared against the npm `latest` dist-tag; each companion MCP server is resolved on its registry (`get_registry_package_status`) and reported when missing, deprecated, or yanked — companions are launched unpinned by npx/uvx, so registry health *is* the dependency surface. Both constants live in Python, invisible to Dependabot |
| Pre-commit hooks | `repo:` / `rev:` blocks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Calls `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/tags` on GitHub for each hook and reports drift when our pinned `rev:` is older than the highest semver-shaped tag. Unauthenticated; full 40- or 64-character Git object IDs are accepted as immutable exemptions, while unsupported revisions and failed lookups make the scan incomplete |
| CDK enum constants | `LAMBDA_PYTHON_RUNTIME` and `LAMBDA_NODEJS_RUNTIME` from `gco/stacks/constants.py` | Introspects the installed `aws-cdk-lib` (the `deps-scan` workflow installs the latest) for `aws_lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_X_Y` and `aws_lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_<major>_X`, then reports drift when a pinned enum is older than the highest matching member exposed by the library. Skipped with a note when `aws-cdk-lib` isn't importable |
| Python release | `LAMBDA_PYTHON_RUNTIME` (the major Python version we standardise on across Lambdas) | Queries `https://endoflife.date/api/python.json` for the highest currently-supported stable cycle and reports drift compared to the `LAMBDA_PYTHON_RUNTIME` constant. Public endpoint, no AWS creds |
| CI tooling | Trivy (the `install-trivy` action's `version` default), `ACTIONLINT_VERSION` (`lint.yml`), Helm and kubectl (the `lambda/helm-installer/Dockerfile` RUN-line pins every workflow derives from), `KUBECONFORM_VERSION`, `CALICO_VERSION`, and `METRICS_SERVER_VERSION` (`integration-tests.yml`), and the kind binary + node image (the workflow-level env of `integration-tests.yml`) | Public endpoints, no AWS creds. Compares each hand-installed CI tool against its upstream (GitHub Releases for Trivy/actionlint/Helm/kind/kubeconform/Calico/Metrics Server, `dl.k8s.io` for kubectl, registry tags within the pinned minor for the kind node image). These are plain env / `with:` pins Dependabot doesn't watch — stale linting, validation, networking, and autoscaling tools can silently weaken CI coverage |
| Version consistency | ruff (pyproject / pre-commit / `lint.yml`), `python-version` across workflows vs the project runtime, each `*_VERSION` env pin across workflow files, the per-job kind/Calico/Metrics Server pins (`CALICO_VERSION` + `CALICO_SHA256`, `METRICS_SERVER_VERSION` + `METRICS_SERVER_SHA256`, kind binary + node image) that the two kind jobs each declare for themselves, every `lambda/*/requirements.txt` pin against the version resolved centrally, and every digest-pinned image carrying two digests under one tag | No network. Reports when copies of a pin that must move together disagree. Two kind jobs on different Calico builds would enforce NetworkPolicy with two different engines, and a version/checksum pair that disagrees fails the download as what looks like a flake; `tests/test_supply_chain_integrity.py::test_repeated_workflow_pins_agree_across_jobs` is the PR-time half of the same contract. Each Lambda is packaged independently, so a library like `boto3` is pinned centrally *and* in one copy per Lambda that declares it — the copies were unwatched, so a central bump could leave production handlers on a version CI never exercised. `check_lambda_requirements_pins` resolves the authoritative version from `[project].dependencies`, then the optional groups, then `requirements-lock.txt` (so lock-only transitives such as `cryptography` are covered too), skips the generated `*-build` staging bundles, and treats an unreadable `pyproject.toml` as a finding rather than a pass; `tests/test_integration.py::TestDependencyVersionConsistency::test_lambda_requirements_match_pyproject` is the PR-time half. `check_image_digest_consistency` closes the related gap for images: an immutable digest is only immutable where it is written down, so when an upstream tag is re-pushed and the pin is refreshed in one file but restated as a literal in another, two digests appear under one tag. It matches references split across adjacent string literals, because the real stale copy was written that way and a line-at-a-time matcher saw no pin at all. Scoped to digest-pinned images on purpose — broader "same repo, different tags" and "digest here, bare tag there" variants were measured against this tree first and produced only legitimate divergence and fixture strings |
| Base-image security epochs | `APT_SECURITY_EPOCH` / `DNF_SECURITY_EPOCH` ARGs in `Dockerfile.dev`, `dockerfiles/*`, and `lambda/helm-installer/Dockerfile` | No network. Flags an epoch older than `SECURITY_EPOCH_STALE_DAYS` (default 45) so a stale cache-bust date masking new OS patches gets bumped |
| Suppression expiries | `exp:` markers in `.github/config/.trivyignore` and `.pip-audit-ignore` | No network. Surfaces entries expiring within `SUPPRESSION_EXPIRY_WARN_DAYS` (default 30) so they're renewed before the CI validator hard-fails a build on the expiry date |
| Lockfile freshness | `pyproject.toml` direct deps vs `requirements-lock.txt` | No network. Requires concrete exact direct pins and matches lock records by normalized package name, canonical marker identity, and exact version. Missing or mismatched records are reported as drift; malformed or non-exact inputs make the scan incomplete |

Images matching `gco/*` are skipped (we build those). Tags without a leading numeric version (`latest`, branch names, SHAs) are ignored. A registry that cannot be reached marks the scan incomplete, and so does a pinned tag the registry no longer lists; a reachable registry with nothing newer in the pin's variant family is simply up to date. The terminal summary ends with an `Incomplete lookups` count so recurring lookup failures are visible at a glance. Acting on a drift report is documented in the [Maintenance guide](../docs/MAINTENANCE.md).

#### Inputs

Set via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `WORKFLOWS_DIR` | `.github/workflows` | Directory scanned for Docker image references in workflow files. Lets forks that vendor workflows elsewhere still use the script. |

#### Outputs

The script writes a Markdown report to a temp file and, when invoked from a workflow, emits two keys on `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` for the caller:

| Output | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `has_drift` | `true` when any scanned surface reported drift, else `false` |
| `report_path` | Path to the Markdown report (only set when `has_drift=true`) |

The report opens with a summary table (every surface, its status, and an urgency hint) linking to per-surface detail sections; skipped checks collapse into a single `<details>` block. When run in CI the script also mirrors the report — or an "up to date" line — into `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, so results show on the workflow run page even when no issue is opened.

Exit code is `0` whether the report is current or contains drift — drift is a
signal, not a scheduled-workflow failure. Deterministic policy findings, live
catalog drift, and operational/parser failures all set `has_drift=true` and join
the report; an unavailable online EC2 check is explicitly marked skipped while
the offline guard still runs. When `has_drift=true` the `deps-scan` workflow
opens **or refreshes** a single rolling GitHub issue labeled
`dependencies, automated`; a stable, date-free title means the same issue is
updated each month rather than a new one piling up. See the
[Maintenance guide](../docs/MAINTENANCE.md#adding-a-new-instance-type-or-family)
for the reviewed accelerator workflow.

#### Running it locally

```bash
# Requires: python3 (with PyYAML; boto3 for online EC2 discovery), pip, jq,
# skopeo, helm, kubectl, awscli
# Missing/invalid AWS credentials explicitly skip AWS-backed reads; offline
# accelerator policy validation still runs.

bash .github/scripts/dependency-scan.sh
```

The console output shows each surface's drift inline. To trigger the exact workflow path from GitHub, go to Actions → "Deps scan" → "Run workflow" and pick `main`.

#### Extending it

- **New Docker image source** — add a `grep … >> "$ALL_IMAGES"` block alongside the existing ones. Anything with a semver tag is picked up automatically.
- **New Helm chart** — nothing to change; the script walks every entry in `lambda/helm-installer/charts.yaml`.
- **New EKS add-on** — add the constant in `gco/stacks/constants.py` and reference it in `regional_stack.py`. The scanner imports from the constants module.
- **New Aurora engine version** — update the plain `AURORA_POSTGRES_VERSION` string in `gco/stacks/constants.py`; the stack applies it with `AuroraPostgresEngineVersion.of()`, so no aws-cdk-lib enum needs to exist.
- **New pre-commit hook** — nothing to change; `extract_precommit_hooks` walks every `repo:` block in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and the GitHub-tags lookup picks up the hook automatically (as long as the upstream lives on GitHub and tags semver-shaped releases).
- **New CDK enum constant** — add the constant in `gco/stacks/constants.py`, then add a comparison block in `dependency-scan.sh`'s "Checking CDK enum constants" section that calls a new `get_latest_<name>` helper from `lib_dependency_scan.sh`. Pattern-match the existing `LAMBDA_PYTHON_RUNTIME` block.
- **New accelerator family or type** — follow the reviewed catalog workflow in [`docs/MAINTENANCE.md`](../docs/MAINTENANCE.md#adding-a-new-instance-type-or-family). Add family policy before `refresh`; synchronize both watch lists and update NodePools only after reviewing architecture, lifecycle, generation, and workload fit. No scanner code change is needed.
- **New default Bedrock model** — change `cdk.json` `context.bedrock.mission_default_model_id` (Mission sampling), `context.bedrock.capacity_advisor_default_model_id` (the capacity advisor's independent default), and/or `context.bedrock.claude_code_default_model_id` (the independent default `gco autopilot` hands to Claude Code), while `tests/test_default_bedrock_model_consistency.py` guards the per-consumer accessors, all pins, and packaged config. The "Checking Bedrock default model" section tracks each key's model family automatically, including `context.bedrock.embedding_model_id` (Mission memory). Embedding drift carries a data caveat: stored vectors are only comparable to vectors from the same model, so re-embed or segregate existing Mission-memory data when adopting a newer embedding model. If a new Mission default has no captured scaffold fixture yet, run `python scripts/capture_scaffold_fixtures.py --model <id>`.
- **New CI tool pin** — add a `check_github_tool <name> <pin> <owner/repo> <url>` call in the "Checking CI tooling pins" section (or a `dl.k8s.io` / registry lookup for non-GitHub tools), reading the current pin via `extract_workflow_env_pin` or `extract_kind_pins` from `lib_dependency_scan.sh`.
- **New consistency check** — add an extractor to `lib_dependency_scan.sh` and a comparison block in the "Checking version consistency" section that records disagreeing copies to `CONSISTENCY_RESULTS`.
- **New recurring-hygiene check** (suppression file, base-image epoch, lockfile, …) — add a parser to `lib_dependency_scan.sh` and a section that filters by the shared thresholds (`SUPPRESSION_EXPIRY_WARN_DAYS`, `SECURITY_EPOCH_STALE_DAYS`). Remember to wire the new `*_COUNT` into the summary, the all-zero `has_drift` gate, and both `rm -f` cleanup lines.

#### Failure modes & debugging

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|--------------|
| `has_drift=false` but you expected drift | The latest-tag query returned empty (rate-limited Docker Hub, private registry). Run with `skopeo` directly to confirm |
| AWS-backed sections explicitly skipped | No AWS credentials. Either expected for a local run or an OIDC misconfiguration. See [Enabling AWS-backed dependency checks](#enabling-aws-backed-dependency-checks) |
| Accelerator offline finding | A NodePool uses deprecated hardware, a newer generation needs review, a watch list differs from the catalog, or an instance pool breaks the three-member/subset/coverage policy. Run `python scripts/accelerator_catalog.py validate` for exact files and recommended changes |
| Accelerator operational finding | Offline validation, online EC2 discovery, or JSON parsing failed. Re-run the named command; do not treat the catalog as current until the operational finding is resolved |
| Helm chart resolution silently skipped | `helm repo add` failed. The script runs with `\|\| true` for these to avoid aborting on a single flaky repo; check the console log |

#### Enabling AWS-backed dependency checks

Several dependency surfaces require authoritative AWS APIs: EKS add-on and
cluster versions, Aurora engine versions, EMR Serverless releases, Bedrock model
profiles, and the enabled-Region EC2 accelerator catalog. Without credentials,
each online surface records an explicit skip; all public and deterministic
offline checks continue. The accelerator validator always checks NodePool policy
and watch-list completeness before any AWS call.

To turn the check on without introducing long-lived access keys, configure a GitHub OIDC trust to a read-only IAM role:

1. **Create the OIDC identity provider in the target AWS account** (one-time, skip if already present):

   ```text
   URL:      https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
   Audience: sts.amazonaws.com
   Thumbprint: (auto-fetched by AWS; no manual step)
   ```

2. **Create a role** `GCODependencyScanRole` with a trust policy scoped to this repo's main branch:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": { "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com" },
       "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
       "Condition": {
         "StringEquals": { "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com" },
         "StringLike":   { "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:aws-solutions-library-samples/global-capacity-orchestrator-on-aws:ref:refs/heads/main" }
       }
     }]
   }
   ```

3. **Attach a least-privilege inline policy** listing only the read-only actions the scan needs. Keep this in sync with `.github/oidc_provider/policy.json` when you add new checks:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{
       "Effect":   "Allow",
       "Action": [
         "bedrock:ListFoundationModels",
         "bedrock:GetFoundationModel",
         "bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles",
         "bedrock:GetInferenceProfile",
         "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes",
         "ec2:DescribeRegions",
         "eks:DescribeAddonVersions",
         "eks:DescribeClusterVersions",
         "elasticmapreduce:ListReleaseLabels",
         "rds:DescribeDBEngineVersions",
         "sts:GetCallerIdentity"
       ],
       "Resource": "*"
     }]
   }
   ```

4. **Add the OIDC step to `deps-scan.yml`** just above the "Run dependency scan" step:

   ```yaml
   permissions:
     id-token: write     # required to mint the OIDC JWT
     contents: read
     issues: write
   steps:
     # ...existing checkout + tooling install steps...
     - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@e6de054238d6b7531b4efff3b6587d9aade6a06c  # v6.2.3
       with:
         role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/GCODependencyScanRole
         aws-region: us-east-1
     - name: Run dependency scan
       # ...
   ```

The script self-detects credentials with `aws sts get-caller-identity`. The
workflow sets `AWS_RETRY_MODE=adaptive` and `AWS_MAX_ATTEMPTS=10`; accelerator
catalog reads are additionally sequential and paginated to avoid regional burst
traffic. No script changes are needed when you enable the role.

### pip-audit-ignore validator

`scripts/check_pip_audit_ignore.py` gates the `security:pip-audit:deps` job in `workflows/security.yml`. It validates the project-local `.pip-audit-ignore` file before pip-audit itself runs, so a stale CVE suppression can't quietly outlive its expiration date and hide a finding forever.

#### What it checks

Each non-comment, non-blank line in `.pip-audit-ignore` must:

- start with the vulnerability ID (e.g. `PYSEC-2025-183`, `CVE-2025-45768`, `GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`); and
- carry an `exp:YYYY-MM-DD` marker somewhere on the same line.

The script fails the workflow when:

- any entry's `exp:` date is on-or-before today (inclusive — the listed date is itself expired, no bonus day); or
- any entry is missing the `exp:` marker entirely or has a malformed date (e.g. `exp:2026-13-40`).

Comment lines (`#…`) and blank lines are skipped. A missing `.pip-audit-ignore` file is treated as clean, not as an error — the suppression file is opt-in.

#### How it's wired

The `security:pip-audit:deps` job runs the validator as a dedicated step before the actual `pip-audit` invocation:

```yaml
- name: Validate .pip-audit-ignore expirations
  run: python3 .github/scripts/check_pip_audit_ignore.py .github/config/.pip-audit-ignore

- name: Run pip-audit
  # ... reads .pip-audit-ignore and converts each ID into --ignore-vuln <ID>
```

Splitting validation into its own step makes the failure surface clearly in the GitHub Actions UI when a suppression expires — the step name itself tells the operator what's wrong.

#### Running it locally

```bash
# Pass current date (default)
python3 .github/scripts/check_pip_audit_ignore.py .github/config/.pip-audit-ignore

# Pin "today" to a specific date — useful for previewing what will fail
# on or after that date
python3 .github/scripts/check_pip_audit_ignore.py .github/config/.pip-audit-ignore --today 2026-09-01
```

Exit codes: `0` (clean), `1` (one or more entries failed), `2` (argparse / I/O error).

#### Tests

Validator coverage lives in `tests/test_pip_audit_ignore_validator.py` (19 tests). It covers happy paths, expired-date detection (boundary tests for ±1 day and equal-to-today), missing or malformed markers, `main()` exit codes / stdout, and a live-file check that runs the committed `.pip-audit-ignore` against the validator with today's date. The live-file check is what catches drift between the suppression file and the validator's own rules.

#### Adding a suppression

Append a single line to `.pip-audit-ignore` with rationale and an expiration date:

```text
# CVE-2026-12345 — Brief one-line description.
#
# Why we're suppressing it (disputed, no upstream fix, not on a code path
# we exercise, etc.). Link to the upstream advisory and any tracking issue

```

Pick an `exp:` date that gives upstream a reasonable window to ship a fix or have the advisory withdrawn (90 days is the typical default). When the date arrives, the validator step fails and forces a re-evaluation — extend with fresh rationale or remove the entry once the underlying CVE is fixed.

## Kind config

- **`kind/kind-calico.yaml`** — kind cluster config with `disableDefaultCNI: true` so Calico can be installed on top and actually enforce the `NetworkPolicy` resources from `lambda/kubectl-applier-simple/manifests/03-network-policies.yaml`. The default kindnet CNI does not enforce NetworkPolicy. Used exclusively by `integration:kind:cluster-e2e`.

## Markdownlint config

Configuration for the `lint:markdownlint:md` job lives in **`.github/config/.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`**. The same file covers three repository-wired CLI surfaces:

- The **GitHub Actions job** (`lint-markdownlint-md` in `workflows/lint.yml`) via `DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action`.
- The **pre-commit hook** (`markdownlint-cli2` in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`).
- The local **npm command** (`npm run lint:markdown`).

The vscode-markdownlint extension is not currently configured to read this nested file: `.vscode/settings.json` contains no markdownlint config path. Do not assume editor diagnostics match CI unless that workspace integration is deliberately added and verified.

The config does two things worth calling out:

1. **Rules** — starts from the markdownlint defaults and disables a few that fire a lot of aesthetic noise against this repo's style (`MD013` line-length, `MD033` inline HTML, `MD036` emphasis-as-heading, `MD041` first-line heading, `MD060` table column style). Every override is commented inline so future maintainers can audit the reason. `MD044` (proper-names) is intentionally left unconfigured: it does a case-insensitive substring match and mangles legitimate lowercase identifiers that share letters with product names (`cdk.json` becomes `cdk.JSON`, `kubernetes-sigs/karpenter` becomes `Kubernetes-sigs/...`, and so on).
2. **Globs** — the `globs` list targets `**/*.md`; the `ignores` list excludes `cdk.out/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`, Lambda build-staging directories, every tool cache, and `.kiro/` (IDE-local workspace content). `gitignore: true` additionally pulls in everything the repo's `.gitignore` already excludes.

To add a new exclusion (e.g. a generated-docs folder), extend the `ignores` list. To loosen or tighten a rule, adjust the `config:` block — see the [markdownlint rule reference](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md) for the full catalog.

## Running checks locally

Most jobs map to a single command you can run locally. Quick reference:

```bash
# Lint (matches jobs in workflows/lint.yml)
ruff format --check gco/ cli/ gco_mcp/ tests/ lambda/ scripts/ diagrams/
ruff check gco/ cli/ gco_mcp/ tests/ lambda/ scripts/ diagrams/
yamllint -c .github/config/.yamllint.yml --strict .
python .github/scripts/verify_action_pins.py   # add --verify-upstream to resolve each tag
bash .github/scripts/use-pinned-npm.sh package.json
npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
npm run lint:markdown
npm ci --prefix lambda/inference-streaming-proxy --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
npm --prefix lambda/inference-streaming-proxy test

# Type check (matches lint:mypy:strict and lint:mypy:stacks)
mypy gco/ cli/ gco_mcp/ scripts/ --exclude 'gco/stacks/'
mypy gco/stacks/ app.py          # requires ".[cdk,typecheck]"

# Unit tests — the whole core suite in one go. CI splits the same set across
# `unit:pytest:core (shard N/M)` jobs and combines coverage in `unit:pytest:core`;
# locally there is no reason to shard.
pytest $(python scripts/split_tests.py --shard 1 --of 1) \
    --cov=gco --cov=cli --cov=gco_mcp

# Or run one shard exactly as CI does (coverage floor off; it applies to the
# combined data only)
pytest $(python scripts/split_tests.py --shard 1 --of 2) \
    --cov=gco --cov=cli --cov=gco_mcp --cov-report= --cov-fail-under=0

# CDK matrices run serially: concurrent in-process synths race while staging
# shared CDK assets. CI fans cdk-nag configs across separate runners instead.
pytest tests/test_nag_compliance.py

# CDK synth / config matrix (matches unit:cdk:synth and unit:cdk:config-matrix)
cdk synth --quiet
pytest tests/test_cdk_synthesis_matrix.py

# Security (matches security:bandit:sast)
bandit -r gco/ cli/ -c pyproject.toml --severity-level medium

# Validate workflow files (matches lint:actionlint:workflows)
actionlint
