# Quick Start Guide

Get GCO (Global Capacity Orchestrator on AWS) running in under 60 minutes.

> **💡 Tip:** GCO includes an [MCP server](gco_mcp/) you can connect to an agent for guided exploration. Ask questions like *"What do I need to deploy?"* or *"Explain the architecture"* and the agent will pull from the docs and source code. See [gco_mcp/README.md](gco_mcp/README.md) for setup.
>
> **🤖 Or let an agent drive:** once the `gco` CLI is installed (Step 1–2 below), `gco autopilot` starts [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) by default, while `gco autopilot --engine codex` starts OpenAI Codex. Both use Amazon Bedrock with the GCO MCP server and recommended companion MCPs wired in. See [docs/AUTOPILOT.md](docs/AUTOPILOT.md).
>
> **🐳 Use the dev container (recommended).** GCO pins exact versions of a lot of Python packages so CI is reproducible. That makes installing on top of an existing Python environment a frequent source of `ResolutionImpossible` / dependency-resolver errors. **The recommended path is the [dev container](#step-1-clone-and-build-the-dev-container)** — it ships Python, Node.js, CDK, kubectl, AWS CLI, and every Python dep at the exact versions CI uses. The host-install path is an **advanced, non-recommended** path kept for contributors who specifically want to develop on their host; if you just want to deploy GCO, skip it.

## Prerequisites Check

The only host-side requirements for the recommended (container) path are AWS credentials and Docker:

```bash
# Verify AWS CLI is configured (or just have ~/.aws populated to mount in)
aws --version
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Verify Docker/Finch is running (Colima also works — see Dockerfile.dev)
docker --version    # or: finch version
docker info         # confirms the daemon is running
```

<details>
<summary>Installing on your host instead? (advanced, non-recommended)</summary>

> **Advanced, non-recommended.** Host installs frequently hit the pinned-version `ResolutionImpossible` / dependency-resolver errors described in the [dev container note](#quick-start-guide) and in [Common Issues](#pip-install-fails-with-resolutionimpossible-or-dependency-conflicts). The recommended path is the [dev container](#step-1-clone-and-build-the-dev-container).

You'll additionally need:

```bash
# Python 3.14+ (3.14 used in CI)
python3 --version

# Node.js 24 and npm 12.0.2 (see .nvmrc and package.json)
node --version
npm --version

# Install and verify the repository's exact npm pin, then the locked CDK CLI
bash .github/scripts/use-pinned-npm.sh package.json
npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
npm exec -- cdk --version
```

You should install GCO into a **fresh** virtual environment or via pipx. Mixing it into an existing Python environment will frequently fail dependency resolution because of the project's pinned versions.
</details>

## Step 1: Clone and Build the Dev Container

> **Recommended path.** This dev-container path is the recommended way to install and run GCO. It avoids the pinned-version `ResolutionImpossible` / dependency-resolver errors described in the [dev container note](#quick-start-guide) above and in [Common Issues](#pip-install-fails-with-resolutionimpossible-or-dependency-conflicts). The [host-install path](#step-2-run-the-gco-cli) is advanced and non-recommended.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd global-capacity-orchestrator-on-aws

# Build the dev container (cached on subsequent runs; ~2 min the first time)
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t gco-dev .
```

The image bundles Python 3.14, Node.js 24, CDK, kubectl, AWS CLI, Docker CLI + Buildx, and all GCO Python dependencies at the exact versions CI uses. The Dockerfile is multi-arch — it builds natively on both `linux/amd64` (Intel/x86_64 hosts and CI) and `linux/arm64` (Apple Silicon Macs, Graviton Linux, etc.) by selecting the right kubectl / AWS CLI / Docker CLI / Buildx binary via `$TARGETARCH`. No `--platform` flag needed. Buildx ships in the image so the multi-arch image mirror and the `linux/amd64` asset builds that `gco stacks deploy-all` runs succeed on Apple Silicon (arm64) as well as x86_64.

## Step 2: Run the GCO CLI

The `gco` CLI is pre-installed inside the container. The `docker.sock` mount lets `cdk deploy` bundle Lambda assets through your host's Docker daemon.

```bash
# Drop into an interactive shell with everything wired up
docker run -it --rm \
  -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -w /workspace \
  gco-dev

# From inside the container
gco --version
```

> **Tip:** save yourself some typing with a shell function on the host. We use a function (rather than a plain alias mounting `$(pwd)`) so that the GCO clone is always mounted at `/workspace` no matter where you call it from — `gco stacks *` and other commands that need `cdk.json` / `app.py` / `gco/` at the workspace root will keep working from any subdirectory of the repo, and from anywhere on disk if you `export GCO_HOME=/path/to/your/clone`:
>
> ```bash
> gco-dev() {
>     local project_root="${GCO_HOME:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)}"
>     # Check for both Dockerfile.dev *and* the gco/ namespace package
>     # so we don't accidentally bind-mount an unrelated repo that
>     # happens to have a Dockerfile.dev at its root.
>     if [[ -z "$project_root" \
>         || ! -f "$project_root/Dockerfile.dev" \
>         || ! -d "$project_root/gco" ]]; then
>         echo "gco-dev: not inside the GCO repo. cd into your clone, or set GCO_HOME." >&2
>         return 1
>     fi
>     docker run --rm \
>         -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro \
>         -v "$project_root:/workspace" \
>         -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
>         -w /workspace \
>         gco-dev "$@"
> }
> # Then run any command directly: gco-dev gco stacks list
> ```
>
> **Colima/Finch users:** the host Docker socket may live somewhere other than `/var/run/docker.sock` — see the header of [`Dockerfile.dev`](Dockerfile.dev) for the right `-v` flag.
>
> **Security note:** mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` gives the container root-equivalent access to your host's Docker daemon. Only use this on trusted hosts.

<summary>Installing the CLI on your host instead (advanced, non-recommended)</summary>

> **Advanced, non-recommended.** This path commonly fails with the pinned-version `ResolutionImpossible` / dependency-resolver errors described in the [dev container note](#quick-start-guide) and in [Common Issues](#pip-install-fails-with-resolutionimpossible-or-dependency-conflicts). The recommended path is the [dev container](#step-1-clone-and-build-the-dev-container).

If you've decided you really want to install on your host (e.g., you're contributing changes to the CLI itself), use a clean isolated environment.

**Option A: pipx (CLI-only):**

```bash
brew install pipx && pipx ensurepath  # macOS

pipx install -e .

gco --version
```

**Option B: pip in a fresh virtualenv (development):**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -e ".[dev]"

gco --version
```

If pip fails with `ResolutionImpossible` or similar resolver errors, this is the pinned-versions issue called out at the top of this guide. Either start from a fresh venv or switch to the dev container — please don't try to relax the pins on your end.
</details>

## First Success Milestone

**This milestone incurs no AWS charges.** It runs entirely on your machine and confirms the `gco` CLI works inside the dev container before you deploy anything billable.

The recommended **Onboarding_Path** from a fresh clone to this milestone is the following sequentially numbered list. Every command needed is in this guide, so no step requires reading application, CLI, or infrastructure source:

1. Clone the repository and enter it (see [Step 1](#step-1-clone-and-build-the-dev-container)):

   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd global-capacity-orchestrator-on-aws
   ```

   Replace `<REPOSITORY_URL>` with the Git URL of this repository (for example the HTTPS or SSH clone URL from your fork or the upstream remote).

2. Build the dev container from `Dockerfile.dev` (see [Step 1](#step-1-clone-and-build-the-dev-container)):

   ```bash
   docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t gco-dev .
   ```

3. Run the `gco` CLI inside the container (see [Step 2](#step-2-run-the-gco-cli)):

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm \
     -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws:ro \
     -v $(pwd):/workspace \
     -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     -w /workspace \
     gco-dev
   ```

4. Verify the install — this is the milestone. From inside the container, run:

   ```bash
   gco --version
   ```

   Success looks like the `gco` CLI printing its version and exiting without error:

   ```text
   gco, version 2.0.2
   ```

   When you see a `gco, version …` line and no error, your environment is correctly set up and you have reached the First Success Milestone.

> **Verification failed?** If `gco --version` does not print a `gco, version …` line — for example you see `command not found`, a Python import error, or a `ResolutionImpossible` / dependency-resolver error — go to [Common Issues](#common-issues) for the fix. The most reliable resolution is to use the [dev container](#step-1-clone-and-build-the-dev-container), which ships every dependency at the exact versions CI uses. You never need to read source code to get past this step.

After this milestone, the next checkpoint is the **First Deploy Milestone** in [Step 4](#step-4-deploy-infrastructure). **That step provisions billable AWS resources**, unlike this milestone. Steps labeled *(Optional)* below are not required to reach the First Success Milestone.

## Step 3: Bootstrap CDK (Optional)

CDK bootstrap runs automatically during `deploy` and `deploy-all` if a region hasn't been bootstrapped yet. You can skip this step entirely.

If you prefer to bootstrap manually:

```bash
# Bootstrap CDK in your target region (optional — deploy will do this automatically)
gco stacks bootstrap -r us-east-1
```

## Step 4: Deploy Infrastructure

> **First Deploy Milestone — this step provisions billable AWS resources.** Unlike the [First Success Milestone](#first-success-milestone), deploying infrastructure creates AWS resources (EKS, VPC, load balancer, API Gateway, Lambda, and more) that incur charges until you [clean up](#clean-up).

Run this from inside the dev container shell you started in [Step 2](#step-2-run-the-gco-cli) (or non-interactively, e.g. `gco-dev gco stacks deploy-all -y` using the alias from Step 2):

```bash
# Start Finch VM (if using Finch on the host — Docker Desktop & Colima need no equivalent)
finch vm start

# Deploy all stacks
gco stacks deploy-all -y
```

Or deploy a single region:

```bash
gco stacks deploy gco-us-east-1 -y
```

> **Note:** The CLI automatically detects Docker or Finch. If you need to override, set `CDK_DOCKER=docker` or `CDK_DOCKER=finch`.

**What's being created:**

- VPC with public/private subnets
- EKS Auto Mode cluster
- Application Load Balancer
- API Gateway
- Lambda function for kubectl operations
- Health Monitor and Manifest Processor services

## Step 5: Configure Cluster Access (Optional)

> **Important:** The default EKS endpoint mode is `PRIVATE`, which means kubectl access from outside the VPC is not available. Most users don't need this — you can submit jobs via SQS (`gco jobs submit-sqs`) or API Gateway (`gco jobs submit`) without kubectl access.
>
> If you do need direct kubectl access (e.g., for debugging or manual operations), you must first change the endpoint mode to `PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE` in `cdk.json`:
>
> ```json
> "endpoint_access": "PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE"
> ```
>
> Then redeploy the regional stack:
>
> ```bash
> gco stacks deploy gco-us-east-1 -y
> ```

Once the endpoint is set to `PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE`:

```bash
# Setup kubectl access
./scripts/setup-cluster-access.sh gco-us-east-1 us-east-1
```

**What this script does:**

- Configures kubectl access to the cluster
- Adds your IAM principal to the EKS access entries
- Verifies all components are running

## Step 6: Run a Test Job

**Via API Gateway (recommended — works with the default PRIVATE endpoint):**

```bash
# Submit a job via the API Gateway (uses SigV4 auth, no kubectl needed)
gco jobs submit examples/simple-job.yaml -n gco-jobs

# Check job status
gco jobs list --all-regions

# View logs once the job completes
gco jobs logs hello-gco -n gco-jobs -r us-east-1

# Clean up
gco jobs delete hello-gco -n gco-jobs -r us-east-1 -y
```

**Other submission methods:**

```bash
# Via SQS — queues the job for pickup by a KEDA-scaled processor.
# Via SQS queue (recommended — processed automatically by the built-in queue processor)
gco jobs submit-sqs examples/simple-job.yaml --region us-east-1

# Via kubectl (requires PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE endpoint mode — see Step 5)
kubectl apply -f examples/simple-job.yaml
```

## Success! 🎉

Your GCO cluster is ready. Here are some things to try:

```bash
# Check GPU capacity before submitting GPU jobs
gco capacity check --instance-type g4dn.xlarge --region us-east-1

# Get a region recommendation for your workload
gco capacity recommend --instance-type g5.xlarge --region us-east-1

# View costs by region
gco costs summary

# Run a multi-step pipeline (DAG)
gco dag run examples/pipeline-dag.yaml --region us-east-1

# Check cluster health
gco capacity status
```

## Step 7: Deploy an Inference Endpoint (Optional)

GCO can also deploy long-running inference endpoints across regions. Here's a quick example:

```bash
# Deploy a vLLM inference endpoint
gco inference deploy my-llm \
  -i vllm/vllm-openai:v0.28.0 \
  --gpu-count 1 \
  -e MODEL=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
  -r us-east-1

# Check deployment progress
gco inference status my-llm

# List all inference endpoints
gco inference list

# Clean up when done
gco inference delete my-llm -y
```

The `inference_monitor` in each target region automatically creates the Kubernetes Deployment, Service, autoscaling objects, and supporting configuration. Inference requests remain behind the shared authenticated Gateway API route; the monitor does not create a direct per-endpoint route. See [docs/INFERENCE.md](docs/INFERENCE.md) for the full inference guide including model weight management, multi-region deployment, and supported frameworks.

## Next Steps

- Follow the [Learning Path](docs/LEARNING_PATH.md) for a staged, guided route from here to productive
- Read [README.md](README.md) for full documentation
- See [docs/INFERENCE.md](docs/INFERENCE.md) for inference serving guide
- See [docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md) for customization options
- Review [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for architecture details
- Optionally enable [direct Regional API access](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#regional-api-gateway-aggregation-bridge-and-direct-regional-access) for IAM-authorized callers that need an explicitly region-pinned path; the bridge itself is always deployed for aggregation

### MCP Server (for Cursor / Kiro / LLM integration)

GCO includes an MCP server with 139 tools by default (up to 196 with all flags enabled) spanning the CLI and project-aware resources. The dev container already has the `[mcp]` extras installed, so all you need is the client-side config. The most portable form passes an absolute path in `args` (works in Cursor, Kiro, Claude Desktop, etc.):

```jsonc
// MCP client config file (for example, Cursor's ~/.cursor/mcp.json)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gco": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["<ABSOLUTE_REPO_PATH>/gco_mcp/run_mcp.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<ABSOLUTE_REPO_PATH>` with the absolute path to your local GCO clone — the `global-capacity-orchestrator-on-aws` directory created by `git clone` — so `args` resolves to that clone's `gco_mcp/run_mcp.py`. Save the snippet in your MCP client's own config file; its location varies by client (Cursor uses `~/.cursor/mcp.json`), so see [`gco_mcp/README.md`](gco_mcp/README.md) for each client's path, including a `cwd`-shorthand variant for Kiro.

After saving, reload the `gco` server in your MCP client's settings UI so the tool descriptors get picked up. If you're running outside the dev container, install the MCP extras into your venv first:

```bash
pip install -e ".[mcp]"
```

## Common Issues

### `pip install` fails with `ResolutionImpossible` or dependency conflicts

GCO pins exact versions of many Python packages (CDK, AWS SDKs, FastAPI, mypy, Ruff, etc.) so CI is reproducible. Installing on top of an existing Python environment frequently triggers resolver errors.

**Fix:** use the [dev container](#step-1-clone-and-build-the-dev-container) — it ships every dep at the correct version and has no overlap with your host Python. If you must install on the host, start from a brand-new virtual environment or use `pipx install -e .` (which gives the CLI its own isolated env).

### CDK CLI version mismatch

If you see `Cloud assembly schema version mismatch`, reinstall the exact repository-owned CDK graph rather than downloading a global latest release:

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
npm exec -- cdk --version
```

The CLI prefers `node_modules/.bin/cdk` from this lockfile. If the local graph is absent, `gco` can still use an already-installed CDK on `PATH`, but contributors and CI should use the locked copy.

### "Stack already exists"

If deployment fails partway through, destroy and redeploy:

```bash
gco stacks destroy-all -y
gco stacks deploy-all -y
```

### "Unauthorized" when using kubectl

Make sure you ran the cluster access setup script (Step 5) and that the endpoint mode is set to `PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE` in `cdk.json`.

### Pods not starting

Check pod events for details:

```bash
kubectl describe pods -n gco-system
```

## Clean Up

When you're done testing:

```bash
# Destroy all stacks
gco stacks destroy-all -y
```
