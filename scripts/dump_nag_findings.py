"""Dev-only helper: run the cdk-nag compliance test harness and print
a human-readable inventory of every finding, grouped by rule +
resource-path + finding-id, with the config name(s) each finding
appears under.

When to use this
----------------
Reach for this script when ``tests/test_nag_compliance.py`` starts
failing and you need a compact view of what cdk-nag is actually
objecting to. pytest's default output buries the per-finding detail
inside an ``AssertionError`` repr — useful for CI gate failures, but
hard to read when you're trying to scope a new ``NagSuppressions``
entry. This script:

1. Iterates the same ``CONFIGS`` list pytest does (imported from
   ``tests._cdk_config_matrix`` so the two can never drift).
2. For each config, builds the full CDK app the way ``app.py`` does,
   attaches a ``CapturingCdkNagLogger`` to every rule pack, calls
   ``app.synth()``, and collects the raw findings.
3. Groups them by ``(rule_id, resource_path, finding_id)`` so a
   wildcard that appears in 24 configs shows up once with the list
   of config names rather than 24 repeated entries.
4. Exits 0 if zero findings, 1 otherwise — which matches the pytest
   gate and means you can pipe this script's output to
   ``pre-commit`` or use it as a quick smoke before pushing.

When NOT to use this
--------------------
CI should use the pytest gate, not this script. This prints to stdout
and doesn't produce a junit.xml. For development use only.

Relationship to other tooling
-----------------------------
* ``tests/test_nag_compliance.py`` — the PR gate. Parameterizes over
  the same ``CONFIGS`` and fails if any unsuppressed finding exists.
* ``scripts/test_cdk_synthesis.py`` — runs ``cdk synth --quiet`` as a
  subprocess for each config. Catches toolchain and node-side
  breakage; does NOT catch cdk-nag findings because synth exits 0
  even when unsuppressed findings exist (that was the us-east-1
  deploy bug).
* ``tests/_cdk_nag_logger.py`` — the ``INagLogger`` implementation
  that all three tools share. Route all rule packs' findings into a
  Python list.

Typical workflow
----------------
    # A finding shows up in CI on your PR. Reproduce locally:
    python3 scripts/dump_nag_findings.py

    # Scope the suppression in gco/stacks/nag_suppressions.py or
    # whichever construct owns the resource, ideally with
    # ``applies_to`` as tight as possible (prefer a regex or literal
    # ARN over an unscoped blanket).
    # Re-run:
    python3 scripts/dump_nag_findings.py
    # -> exits 0, no findings.

    # Then run the full pytest gate to confirm:
    pytest tests/test_nag_compliance.py -n auto -q
