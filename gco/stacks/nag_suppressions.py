"""CDK-nag suppression utilities for GCO stacks.

This module provides centralized suppression management for cdk-nag rules
that are intentionally not applicable or have documented justifications.

Supported Compliance Frameworks:
- AWS Solutions: Best practices for AWS architectures
- HIPAA Security: Healthcare compliance requirements
- NIST 800-53 Rev 5: Federal security controls
- PCI DSS 3.2.1: Payment card industry standards
- Serverless: Best practices for serverless architectures

Suppression Categories:
1. AWS Managed Policies - Required for EKS/Lambda integrations
2. Inline Policies - CDK-generated for custom resources
3. Wildcard Permissions - Required for dynamic resource access
4. Infrastructure Patterns - Intentional architectural decisions
