"""
Regional stack for GCO (Global Capacity Orchestrator on AWS) - EKS cluster and ALB per region.

This is the largest stack in the project (~3200 lines) and creates all regional
resources for a single AWS region. One instance is deployed per region defined
in cdk.json.

Resources Created:
    VPC & Networking:
        - VPC spanning every AZ in the region, public subnets (NAT), private subnets (EKS and ALB)
        - 2 NAT Gateways for high availability
        - VPC endpoints for ECR, S3, STS, Secrets Manager, SSM, CloudWatch
        - VPC Flow Logs (CloudWatch Logs, 30-day retention)

    EKS Cluster (Auto Mode):
        - Managed control plane with full logging (API, Audit, Authenticator, Controller Manager, Scheduler)
        - Built-in NodePools: system, general-purpose
        - Custom NodePools: gpu-x86-pool, gpu-arm-pool, gpu-inference-pool,
          gpu-efa-pool, mooncake-efa-pool, neuron-pool, cpu-general-pool
        - IRSA roles for service accounts (Secrets Manager, SQS, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, S3, EFS)

    Load Balancing:
        - Internal ALB created from Gateway API resources by the self-managed
          AWS Load Balancer Controller
        - Always-deployed regional API bridge reaches the ALB through a VPC Lambda;
          direct caller access is optional in ``aws`` and required elsewhere
        - Global Accelerator endpoint registration in commercial ``aws`` only

    Storage:
        - EFS with dynamic provisioning (CSI driver, access points, encryption at rest + in transit)
        - FSx for Lustre (optional, toggled via cdk.json)
        - Valkey Serverless cache (optional)
        - Aurora Serverless v2 with pgvector (optional)

    Lambda Functions:
        - kubectl-applier: applies K8s manifests during deployment
        - helm-installer: installs Helm charts (KEDA, Volcano, KubeRay, etc.)
        - ga-registration: registers the ALB with Global Accelerator in ``aws``
        - regional-api-proxy: separate-stack VPC proxy used by the always-on
          aggregation bridge and by optional direct callers in ``aws`` or the
          required regional workload ingress in other partitions

    Container Images:
        - ECR repositories + Docker image builds for health-monitor, manifest-processor,
          inference-proxy, inference-monitor, queue-processor

    SQS:
        - Regional job queue + dead letter queue (for gco jobs submit-sqs)

Key Design Decisions:
    - EKS Auto Mode handles node provisioning — no managed node groups or Karpenter provisioners
    - NodePools use WhenEmpty consolidation for inference to avoid disrupting long-running pods
    - IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) for least-privilege pod-level AWS access
    - All optional features (FSx, Valkey, Aurora) are toggled via cdk.json context variables
    - Template variables in K8s manifests ({{PLACEHOLDER}}) are replaced at deploy time

Dependencies:
    - GCOGlobalStack (partition-wide state and, in ``aws``, Global Accelerator endpoint groups)
    - GCOApiGatewayGlobalStack (for auth secret ARN)

Modification Guide:
    - To add a new NodePool: add a YAML manifest in lambda/kubectl-applier-simple/manifests/ (40-49 range)
    - To add a new service: add ECR image build here, Dockerfile in dockerfiles/, manifest in manifests/
    - To add a new optional feature: add a cdk.json context toggle, guard with if/else in this file
    - To change EKS version: update KUBERNETES_VERSION in constants.py

        CDK's ``cr.AwsCustomResource`` defaults to auto-generating a per-
        construct Lambda execution role from the ``policy=`` parameter.
        Internally, CDK deduplicates those auto-generated roles onto a
        single *singleton* provider Lambda (logical id prefix
        ``AWS679f53fac002430cb0da5b7982bd22872``), and merges each custom
        resource's policy statements onto that Lambda's role at stack
        create time. On cold deploys, CloudFormation invokes the Lambda
        within 2-3 seconds of attaching a new policy statement, which is
        faster than IAM's global propagation window. The symptom is a
        ``iam:PassRole NOT authorized`` failure on whichever addon role
        update happens to run right after its ``iam:PassRole`` policy
        statement was attached but before it had replicated.

        The fix is to create the role up front, attach every policy
        statement the stack will need during stack creation, and pass
        ``role=self.aws_custom_resource_role`` to every
        ``AwsCustomResource`` instead of ``policy=``. Because the role
        already exists — and its inline policy has had minutes to
        replicate by the time any ``AwsCustomResource`` actually fires —
        the race disappears entirely.

        This method creates the role with the statements we can compute
        without a cluster reference (EKS ``UpdateAddon`` / ``DescribeAddon``
        scoped to this cluster, and SSM ``GetParameter`` for the endpoint
        group ARN). ``iam:PassRole`` statements for individual addon
        roles (EFS CSI, FSx CSI, CloudWatch Observability) are appended
        by each ``_create_*_addon`` method after the corresponding IRSA
        role has been created, so every PassRole ``resources=`` list
        stays precise (no wildcards) and cdk-nag stays happy.

        owned by ``GCOGlobalStack`` (the model bucket and the cluster-shared

        cold-tier choice.

           principals encrypt/decrypt so S3 server-side encryption and access-log
           delivery work without role-side grants.
        2. ``regional_shared_access_logs_bucket`` — the dedicated S3 access-logs
           destination for the primary bucket.
        3. ``regional_shared_bucket`` — the primary bucket named
           ``<project_name>-regional-shared-<account>-<region>`` (the prefix
           from ``regional_shared_bucket_name_prefix(project_name)`` is the
           stable ARN prefix used by IAM policies and nag assertions).
           KMS-encrypted with
           ``regional_shared_kms_key``, block-public-access on, SSL enforced,
           versioned, destroy-on-teardown.

        An explicit ``Deny`` for ``aws:SecureTransport=false`` is added to the

        The MCP server exposes GCO CLI tools to LLM agents. Without a dedicated
        role, the server would inherit the full ambient credentials of the user
        who launches it (often an administrator). This method creates a
        least-privilege role that the MCP server can assume at startup via
        ``GCO_MCP_ROLE_ARN``.

        Permissions are scoped to the minimum needed by the tools exposed:

        - ``eks:DescribeCluster`` on this regional EKS cluster ARN only.
        - ``s3:GetObject`` on model weights buckets. The model bucket lives in
          the global stack, so we scope to the same name pattern used by the
          service account role (``{project_name}-*``). This is a deliberate
          compromise: a precise cross-stack ARN export would force a tight
          dependency on the global stack, and cdk-nag will flag it anyway
          because the bucket name is auto-generated.
        - ``cloudwatch:GetMetricData`` / ``cloudwatch:ListMetrics``. These APIs
          do not support resource-level IAM, so wildcard is required. Read-only.
        - ``sqs:SendMessage`` scoped to this region's job queue ARN only.

        The trust policy uses ``AccountRootPrincipal`` so any IAM user/role in
        the account can assume it (gated by an explicit sts:AssumeRole
        permission on the caller — standard AWS behavior). Operators who want
        to restrict assumption further should add an external-id or principal
        condition to the trust policy after deployment.
