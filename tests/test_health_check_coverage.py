"""
Consistency tests between ALB Ingress health-check paths and the
auth middleware allowlist.

Parses every Kubernetes Ingress manifest under
lambda/kubectl-applier-simple/manifests/ (skipping any with unresolved
template variables), pulls the alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path
annotation, and asserts each one appears in
gco.services.auth_middleware.UNAUTHENTICATED_PATHS. Also checks that
the GA health check path from cdk.json is allowlisted. Prevents the
regression where a new Ingress lands with a health-check path that the
middleware rejects with 403, silently taking the region out of GA
rotation.
