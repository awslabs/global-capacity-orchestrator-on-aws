"""
Tests for ``_augment_trusted_registries_with_project_ecr``.

This pure helper extends the operator-configured ``trusted_registries``
list with the project's own per-account ECR registry hostnames so jobs
built via ``gco images build`` aren't rejected by either of the two
submission-path validators (queue_processor on SQS, manifest_processor
on REST). The augmentation is order-stable and idempotent — re-running
synthesis must produce a deterministic ConfigMap so deploys don't
churn between runs that have no real config change.
