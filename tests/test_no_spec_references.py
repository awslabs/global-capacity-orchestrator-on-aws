"""Guardrail that fails if internal planning-document references leak into production code or human-facing docs.

The spec workflow keeps planning artifacts under ``.kiro/specs/`` — those are
internal to the design process and are not part of the user-facing project. If
production source files, examples, scripts, or shipped documentation refer to
them by name (or to the prose patterns that typically introduce them), readers
who do not have access to ``.kiro/`` get dangling references.

This test walks the production tree, the test tree, the examples and docs
trees, and the project-root README family, and fails loudly with file paths and
line numbers if any of the prohibited substrings appear.

Prohibited substrings (matched case-insensitively as plain substrings):

* ``requirements.md``
* ``design.md``
* ``tasks.md``
* ``bugfix.md``
* ``per the requirements``
* ``per the design``
* ``per the spec``
* ``as the spec says``
* ``see the requirements doc``
* ``see the design doc``
* ``see the tasks doc``

The test passes silently when none are present.
