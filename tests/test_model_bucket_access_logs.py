"""
Tests for S3 server access logging on the model weights bucket.

Synthesizes GCOGlobalStack against a minimal MockConfigLoader and
asserts against the CloudFormation template that both buckets exist
(model weights + dedicated access-logs bucket), that LoggingConfiguration
wires the first to the second, that the access-logs bucket carries a
lifecycle rule expiring objects at 90 days by default (and honors a
custom s3_access_logs.retention_days context override), and that
public access is blocked on both buckets. No Docker or AWS calls —
pure template assertions.
