## Global Options

These options are available for all commands:

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--config` | `-c` | Path to config file |
| `--region` | `-r` | Default AWS region |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output format: `table`, `json`, `yaml` |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Enable verbose output |
| `--regional-api` | | Require the authorized direct regional API path instead of the global endpoint |
| `--help` | | Show help message |
| `--version` | | Show version |

### Regional API Mode

Every workload region has a regional API bridge because the centralized
aggregator uses it to reach that region's private VPC. In the commercial `aws`
partition, the bridge's resource policy admits only the aggregator role by
default, and `api_gateway.regional_api_enabled=true` additionally permits
IAM-authorized principals from the deployment account. In other partitions,
same-account direct access is enabled automatically because [Global Accelerator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html)
and its global proxy routes are omitted.

When a command supplies an exact target region, the CLI automatically resolves
and signs against that region's API Gateway; it never forwards a routing header
to the global endpoint. When `--regional-api` is enabled (or
`GCO_REGIONAL_API=true` is set), the CLI requires a selected region for every API
call and never uses the global API Gateway → Global Accelerator path. In `aws`,
enable the policy opt-in in `cdk.json` and redeploy before using either form of
direct regional access. Outside `aws`, the deployment enables that same-account
policy automatically. The global endpoint rejects `X-GCO-Target-Region` rather
than silently pretending a region pin succeeded.

Both API Gateway hops use AWS-managed TLS and [SigV4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.html). The regional VPC Lambda
then uses HMAC plus deployment-local private-root TLS to the internal ALB.

```bash
# Use the deployed regional API for a single command
gco --regional-api jobs list --region us-east-1

# Or select regional mode for subsequent commands
export GCO_REGIONAL_API=true
gco jobs list --region us-east-1
```

## Commands

### Autopilot Command

Launch a fully configured agent session for GCO—[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) by default, or OpenAI Codex with `--engine codex`. Both use Amazon Bedrock with the GCO MCP server and recommended companion MCP servers preconfigured. Full guide: [docs/AUTOPILOT.md](AUTOPILOT.md).

```bash
# Default engine: Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock
# (context.bedrock.claude_code_default_model_id)
gco autopilot

# Alternate engine: OpenAI Codex on Amazon Bedrock
# (context.bedrock.codex_default_model_id + codex.reasoning_effort)
gco autopilot --engine codex

# Preview either launch without installing, writing, or starting the agent
gco autopilot --dry-run
gco autopilot --engine codex --dry-run

# Override the selected engine's Bedrock model or inference profile.
# Any explicit Codex override intentionally omits canonical reasoning,
# even when its ID equals the configured default.
gco autopilot -m global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6
gco autopilot --engine codex -m global.openai.gpt-5.6-sol

# Resume the previous workspace session using engine-native semantics
gco autopilot --continue
gco autopilot --engine codex --continue

# Enable opt-in GCO MCP tool groups (shared by both engines; repeatable)
gco autopilot -e mission -e infrastructure-deploy
gco autopilot --engine codex -e mission

# Import skills into either engine
gco autopilot --skills ~/team-skills
gco autopilot --engine codex --skills ~/team-skills

# Agents and plugins are Claude Code concepts and are rejected by Codex
gco autopilot --agents ~/my-agents
gco autopilot --plugin ~/plugins/incident-response

# GCO MCP server only, no companions (shared)
gco autopilot --no-companions

# Print the selected engine's generated config: Claude JSON or Codex TOML
gco autopilot --print-config
gco autopilot --engine codex --print-config

# Install the selected pinned CLI without prompting if it is absent
gco autopilot -y
gco autopilot --engine codex -y
```

If the selected `claude` or `codex` binary is missing, Autopilot offers that engine's exact pinned npm install. Neither agent CLI is baked into the dev container; first-use setup stays reproducible, and the monthly dependency scan tracks both pins. See the [Autopilot guide](AUTOPILOT.md) for model and Region precedence, generated JSON/TOML isolation, native argument passthrough, and each engine's resume behavior.

### Status Commands

One read-only command that answers "what is my deployment doing right now?" across every
configured region — the aggregate view that otherwise takes `gco stacks status`,
`gco queue stats`, `gco jobs list --all-regions`, `gco capacity status`, and
`gco inference list` run separately and joined by hand. The same document backs the
`fleet_status` MCP tool, so an agent learns the whole fleet state in one call.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `gco status` | Aggregate fleet status document: stacks, queue, jobs, capacity, inference |

```bash
# Whole-fleet summary across the configured deployment regions
gco status

# One region only
gco status -r us-east-1

# The full document for scripts and agents
gco status --output json

# Include the billed and cluster-bound sections
gco status --with-costs --with-nodepools
gco status --with-policy

# Refresh in place while watching a deploy or a queue drain
gco status --watch 10

# Back a health check: exit 1 when an error-severity finding is present
gco status --fail-on-findings
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--region`, `-r` | Restrict the gather to a single region |
| `--with-costs` | Include the `costs` section (Cost Explorer bills per `GetCostAndUsage` request) |
| `--with-nodepools` | Include the `nodepools` section (needs a reachable cluster API endpoint; private endpoints report `unavailable` and point at `gco cluster tunnel`) |
| `--with-policy` | Include the `policy` section: compare the job-validation policy each region enforces and report any field that differs (one API call per region) |
| `--watch SECONDS` | Re-gather and redraw on an interval (minimum 5 seconds; table output only). With `--with-costs`, the costs section is re-fetched at most every 15 minutes and carries an `as_of` timestamp |
| `--fail-on-findings` | Exit 1 after rendering when any `error`-severity finding is present |

**Sections.** Each is gathered independently, in parallel, under a 30-second
per-section timeout. The default set is Tier 1: free control-plane reads that
need no cluster reachability. Tier 2 costs money per call and Tier 3 needs the
Kubernetes API, so both are opt-in flags.

| Section | Tier | Source |
|---------|------|--------|
| `regions` | 1 | `cdk.json` deployment topology (no AWS call) |
| `stacks` | 1 | CloudFormation status per expected stack, plus deployed optional stacks |
| `queue` | 1 | SQS job-queue and dead-letter-queue depth per region |
| `jobs` | 1 | Job counts by region and status from the queue-statistics API |
| `capacity` | 1 | Queue depth and GPU/CPU utilization per region, with telemetry provenance |
| `inference` | 1 | Inference endpoint desired state from the global registry |
| `costs` | 2 | Cost Explorer 30-day total by service, plus cost-allocation-tag status (`--with-costs`) |
| `policy` | 1 per region | Cross-region job-validation policy agreement (`--with-policy`). No per-region overrides exist, so a differing field means a region was deployed from a different `cdk.json` checkout; each one becomes a warn finding |
| `nodepools` | 3 | Karpenter NodePools per region after an endpoint reachability probe (`--with-nodepools`) |

**Section status vocabulary.** Every section carries a `status`; anything that
is not `ok` or `empty` also carries a human-readable `reason` and the raw
`errors`. The distinction between `empty` and `unavailable` is the point:
"there are no jobs" and "I could not find out whether there are jobs" lead to
opposite decisions.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `ok` | Read succeeded, data present |
| `empty` | Read succeeded, genuinely nothing there — a success, not a degradation |
| `partial` | Some regions or signals worked, others did not |
| `unavailable` | Could not be attempted, for a known reason (stack absent, private endpoint, no `cdk.json`) |
| `error` | Attempted and failed unexpectedly, or exceeded the section timeout |
| `skipped` | Not requested (an opt-in section without its flag) |

**Findings.** The document carries a `findings` list of what looks wrong, each
entry shaped `{severity, section, message}` with severity `error` or `warn` —
for example a stack in a rollback state, a non-empty dead-letter queue, a
region with unavailable telemetry, or a truncated job-count scan. Findings are
derived from the gathered data only (no extra AWS calls), ordered `error`
before `warn`, and rendered first in table mode. The top-level `overall` field
is `ok` or `degraded`, with a `degraded` list naming the responsible sections;
skipped sections alone never degrade the document.

The JSON document — section names, the status vocabulary, and the finding
shape — is the command's public contract: `generated_at`, `project_name`,
`overall`, `degraded`, `findings`, and `sections`. Exit code is 0 whenever a
document was produced, even when degraded; only `--fail-on-findings` maps an
`error`-severity finding to exit 1.

`gco status` reports the deployment that `cdk.json` declares. Without a
checkout it degrades honestly instead of scanning every AWS region — run from
a checkout or pass `--region`. `gco stacks list` remains the tool for
discovering stacks wherever they exist.

#### `gco jobs submit`

Submit a job via API Gateway (SigV4 authenticated).

```bash
gco jobs submit MANIFEST_PATH [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**

- `MANIFEST_PATH` - Path to YAML manifest file

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--namespace` | `-n` | Fallback namespace for manifests that don't declare their own (manifest `metadata.namespace` takes precedence) |
| `--region` | `-r` | Target specific region |

| `--check-policy` | | Check the manifests against the target region's deployed policy first and report anything that would be rejected (advisory; submission continues) |
| `--label` | `-l` | Add labels (key=value), can be repeated |
| `--wait` | `-w` | Wait for job completion |
| `--timeout` | | Wait timeout in seconds (default: 3600) |

**Example:**

gco jobs submit examples/simple-job.yaml -n gco-jobs
gco jobs submit job.yaml --dry-run
gco jobs submit job.yaml -l team=ml -l priority=high
```

#### `gco jobs submit-sqs`

Submit a job via SQS queue (recommended for production).

```bash
gco jobs submit-sqs MANIFEST_PATH [OPTIONS]
```

| `--region` | `-r` | Target region for SQS queue |
| `--auto-region` | | Auto-select optimal region based on capacity |
| `--priority` | `-p` | Job priority (0-100, higher = more important) |

gco jobs submit-sqs job.yaml --auto-region --priority 10
```

#### `gco jobs submit-direct`

Submit a job directly via kubectl (requires EKS access).

If a job with the same name already exists:

- Completed or failed jobs are silently deleted and replaced
- Active (running/pending) jobs are preserved, and the new submission is auto-renamed with a `-{5char}` suffix

```bash
gco jobs submit-direct MANIFEST_PATH [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Target region |
| `--namespace` | `-n` | Fallback namespace for manifests that don't declare their own (manifest `metadata.namespace` takes precedence) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco jobs submit-direct examples/simple-job.yaml --region us-east-1 -n gco-jobs
```

#### `gco jobs submit-queue`

Submit a job to the global DynamoDB queue for regional pickup.

```bash
gco jobs submit-queue MANIFEST_PATH [OPTIONS]
```

Jobs are stored in DynamoDB and picked up by the target region's manifest processor. This enables global job submission with centralized tracking and status history.

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Target region for job execution (required) |
| `--namespace` | `-n` | Kubernetes namespace |
| `--priority` | `-p` | Job priority (0-100, higher = more important) |
| `--label` | `-l` | Add labels (key=value), can be repeated |

**Example:**

```bash
gco jobs submit-queue examples/simple-job.yaml --region us-east-1
gco jobs submit-queue job.yaml -r us-west-2 --priority 50
gco jobs submit-queue job.yaml -r us-east-1 -l team=ml -l project=training
```

**Note:** Use `gco queue list` or `gco queue get <job_id>` to track job status.

#### `gco jobs list`

List jobs in GCO clusters.

```bash
gco jobs list [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Target region (required unless --all-regions) |
| `--all-regions` | `-a` | Query all regions via global API |
| `--namespace` | `-n` | Filter by namespace |
| `--status` | `-s` | Filter by status |
| `--limit` | `-l` | Maximum results (default: 50) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco jobs list --region us-east-1
gco jobs list --all-regions
gco jobs list -r us-west-2 -n gco-jobs --status running
```

#### `gco jobs get`

Get details of a specific job.

```bash
gco jobs get JOB_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Job region (required) |
| `--namespace` | `-n` | Job namespace |

**Example:**

```bash
gco jobs get my-job --region us-east-1
gco jobs get training-job -r us-west-2 -n ml-jobs
```

**Node placement:** the output reports which node the job's pods landed on and
that node's instance type and spot/on-demand capacity type. A job constrained
to a *set* of interchangeable instance types is placed by
[Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/) within that set, so the manifest records
only what the job was authorized to use — this reports what it used.

```text
  Placement
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NODE                                      INSTANCE TYPE     CAPACITY   PODS
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ip-10-0-1-100.ec2.internal                g5.2xlarge        spot       1
    karpenter.sh/capacity-type: spot
    karpenter.sh/nodepool: gco-gpu
    kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
    node.kubernetes.io/instance-type: g5.2xlarge
    topology.kubernetes.io/zone: us-east-1a
```

`--output json` exposes the same facts as top-level `node_name`,
`node_instance_type`, `node_capacity_type`, `node_labels` and `nodes` fields.
They are absent rather than guessed when nothing is scheduled yet or the pods
have already been garbage-collected. See
[Get Job](API.md#get-job) for the field-by-field reference.

#### `gco jobs logs`

Get logs from a job.

```bash
gco jobs logs JOB_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Job region (required) |
| `--namespace` | `-n` | Job namespace |
| `--tail` | `-t` | Number of lines to show |
| `--container` | `-c` | Container name (for multi-container pods) |
| `--node` | | Node rank to fetch for a distributed TrainJob (default: 0) |

Kubeflow TrainJobs are resolved automatically: logs come from the
rank-`--node` pod of the training job (rank 0 by default).

**Example:**

```bash
gco jobs logs my-job --region us-east-1
gco jobs logs my-job -r us-east-1 --tail 500
gco jobs logs multi-container-job -r us-east-1 --container sidecar
gco jobs logs my-trainjob -r us-east-1 --node 1
```

#### `gco jobs pod-logs`

Get logs from a specific pod of a job. Use this when a Job creates
multiple pods (parallelism > 1) and you need logs from a particular
replica. Use `gco jobs pods` first to list available pods.

```bash
gco jobs pod-logs JOB_NAME POD_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Job region (required) |
| `--namespace` | `-n` | Job namespace |
| `--tail` | `-t` | Number of lines to show |
| `--container` | `-c` | Container name (for multi-container pods) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco jobs pod-logs training-job training-job-abc123 -r us-east-1

gco jobs events training-job -r us-west-2 -n ml-jobs
```

#### `gco jobs pods`

Get pod details for a job, including the node and instance type each pod
landed on.

```bash
gco jobs pods JOB_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Job region (required) |
| `--namespace` | `-n` | Job namespace |

**Example:**

```bash
gco jobs health --region us-east-1
gco jobs health --all-regions
```

#### `gco jobs check-policy`

Check which regions would admit a manifest, and whether the regions still agree
on policy.

Two questions [`gco jobs policy`](#gco-jobs-policy) leaves to you. It shows one
region's policy; this evaluates a manifest against every region's policy using
the same checks the manifest processor runs, and compares the regions to each
other.

**Which regions would take this job.** A 32-GPU job can be admissible in one
region and over-cap in another. Without this you find out by submitting and
being rejected.

**Whether the regions still agree.** There are no per-region policy overrides —
every region is deployed from the same `cdk.json` — so any field that differs
means at least one region is running a different deployment of that file. Each
region looks individually healthy, so this stays invisible until a manifest that
was admitted yesterday is refused. `trusted_registries` is compared with ECR
hostnames stripped, because CDK appends the project's own registries at synth
time and those encode a region; the stripped entries are reported separately as
synth-time augmentation.

Omit `MANIFEST_PATH` to compare policies without judging anything.

Advisory. The cluster is the authoritative gate and this reads a snapshot of its
policy over the network, so it exits 0 unless you pass `--fail-on-reject`. A
check that blocked on its own opinion would refuse valid jobs whenever it was
stale or wrong.

```bash
gco jobs check-policy [MANIFEST_PATH] [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Region to check (repeatable). Defaults to every configured region. |
| `--namespace` | `-n` | Namespace to assume for manifests that don't declare their own |
| `--offline` | | Read `cdk.json` instead of calling AWS (no credentials needed) |
| `--fail-on-reject` | | Exit 1 when any checked region would reject, after printing |

`--offline` answers the same question with no AWS calls, for pre-commit hooks and
air-gapped checkouts. It is strictly weaker: it reports what the file
*configures*, not what any region has *deployed*, and since CDK adds project ECR
registries at synth time an image-provenance rejection offline may pass in a real
region. The output says so.

**Example:**

```bash
gco jobs check-policy examples/gpu-job.yaml
gco jobs check-policy examples/gpu-job.yaml -r us-east-1 -r us-east-2
gco jobs check-policy                       # policy comparison only
gco jobs check-policy examples/gpu-job.yaml --offline --fail-on-reject
gco -o json jobs check-policy examples/gpu-job.yaml | jq '.policy_drift'
```

To surface policy drift across the whole fleet instead of per manifest, use
[`gco status --with-policy`](#status-commands), which reports each differing field as
a warn-severity finding.

#### `gco jobs policy`

Show the job validation policy a region actually enforces — the per-manifest
cpu/memory/gpu caps, `allowed_namespaces`, `allowed_kinds`, `trusted_registries`,
the pod-security `block_*` flags, and the namespace's live `LimitRange` /
`ResourceQuota` ceilings.

Use it before submitting to check whether a manifest will be admitted, rather
than discovering a policy conflict after a region has been provisioned.

This reads the deployed cluster, not your local `cdk.json`. The two diverge
whenever the stack was deployed from a different checkout, and CDK adds the
project's own ECR registries to `trusted_registries` at synth time, so the
effective allowlist is always larger than the configured one. Note that
`gco jobs submit --dry-run` is a client-side `kubectl` parse, not an admission
preview — it never consults this policy.

```bash
gco jobs policy [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Target region (required) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco jobs policy --region us-east-1
gco jobs policy -r us-east-1 -o json | jq '.policy.trusted_registries'
```

See [Reading the deployed validation policy](API.md#reading-the-deployed-validation-policy)
for the response shape and the three admission layers.

#### `gco jobs queue-status`

View SQS queue status across regions.

```bash
gco jobs queue-status [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Filter by region |
| `--all-regions` | | Show all regions |

**Example:**

```bash
gco jobs queue-status --all-regions
gco jobs queue-status -r us-east-1
```

### Queue Commands

Manage the global job queue (DynamoDB-backed). The job queue provides centralized job submission and tracking across all regions.

<details>
<summary>All <code>gco queue</code> commands (5) — click to expand</summary>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`gco queue submit`](#gco-queue-submit) | Submit a job to the global queue for regional pickup. |
| [`gco queue list`](#gco-queue-list) | List jobs in the global queue. |
| [`gco queue get`](#gco-queue-get) | Get details of a queued job including status history. |
| [`gco queue cancel`](#gco-queue-cancel) | Cancel a queued job (only works for jobs not yet running). |
| [`gco queue stats`](#gco-queue-stats) | Get job queue statistics by region and status. |

</details>

#### `gco queue submit`

Submit a job to the global queue for regional pickup.

```bash
gco queue submit MANIFEST_PATH [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Target region for job execution (required) |
| `--namespace` | `-n` | Kubernetes namespace |
| `--priority` | `-p` | Job priority (0-100, higher = more important) |
| `--label` | `-l` | Add labels (key=value), can be repeated |
| `--max-spot-price` | | Spot price cap in USD/hour; the job stays queued until the current spot price of `--spot-instance-type` in the target region drops to or below this value. Requires `--spot-instance-type` |
| `--spot-instance-type` | | EC2 instance type whose spot price gates dispatch (e.g. `g5.xlarge`). Requires `--max-spot-price` |

With the spot price gate set, the regional queue worker re-evaluates the instance type's lowest current spot price across the region's Availability Zones on every polling pass and only dispatches once it clears the cap. `gco queue get` shows the gate and the last observed price; the job waits indefinitely until the price clears or you cancel it with `gco queue cancel`. Price-gated jobs never block other queued work. See [docs/COST_MONITORING.md](COST_MONITORING.md#spot-price-aware-scheduling).

**Example:**

```bash
gco queue submit job.yaml --region us-east-1
gco queue submit job.yaml -r us-west-2 --priority 50
gco queue submit job.yaml -r us-east-1 -l team=ml -l project=training

# Cost-gated: dispatch only when g5.xlarge spot drops to <= $0.50/hour
gco queue submit job.yaml -r us-east-1 --max-spot-price 0.50 --spot-instance-type g5.xlarge
```

| `--retain-volumes` | | Report the cluster's orphaned EBS volumes instead of deleting them |

#### `gco stacks destroy-all`

Destroy all stacks in correct order.

```bash
gco stacks destroy-all [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation |
| `--parallel` | `-p` | Destroy regional stacks in parallel |
| `--max-workers` | `-w` | Max parallel workers (default: 4) |
| `--retain-volumes` | | Report each cluster's orphaned EBS volumes instead of deleting them |

##### Dynamically provisioned EBS volumes

Deleting an EKS cluster does not delete the PersistentVolumes its EBS CSI driver
provisioned, so in-cluster PVCs (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, MLflow) leave
`available` volumes behind that nothing can reattach and that keep billing. They
carry the driver's `kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster>` tags rather than the CDK
`Project` tag, so no project-scoped cleanup or cost query sees them.

Both `destroy` and `destroy-all` therefore delete them once the owning cluster is
confirmed absent, matching the `reclaimPolicy: Delete` the observability
StorageClass already declares. The sweep is scoped to volumes carrying the exact
cluster tag in the target Region, and each volume's ownership, `available` state,
and zero attachments are rechecked immediately before deletion. Pass
`--retain-volumes` to list them instead, with their current monthly cost priced
against the target Region at teardown time; when that price cannot be retrieved
the command says so rather than reporting a stale figure. Either way every volume
is named, so nothing survives silently.

Deletion is irreversible, so use `--retain-volumes` if you want to keep
Prometheus history or take snapshots first.

After stack deletion, `destroy-all` makes a best-effort sweep of known resources
that CloudFormation never modeled. It targets the implicit CloudWatch log groups
created out-of-band by Lambda (`/aws/lambda/<function>`), the EKS control plane
(`/aws/eks/<cluster>/cluster`), and Container Insights
(`/aws/containerinsights/<cluster>/...`), plus the ephemeral SSM bastion's IAM
role and instance profile if a killed tunnel session left them behind.

This cleanup is not an account-wide emptiness proof. ECR repositories or other
resources configured for retention, and unexpected resources outside the known
inventory, may remain. Only exact names derived from the destroyed stacks' own
resources (captured before deletion) are considered, and only for stacks whose
deletion succeeded. Sweep failures are reported best-effort and do not fail the
destroy command; log groups belonging to stacks that failed to delete are left
untouched.

#### `gco stacks bootstrap`

Bootstrap CDK in a region. This is run automatically by `deploy` and `deploy-all` when needed, so manual bootstrapping is optional.

```bash
gco stacks bootstrap [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--account` | `-a` | AWS account ID (defaults to the active credentials) |
| `--region` | `-r` | Region to bootstrap (required) |

#### `gco stacks access`

Configure kubectl access to a GCO EKS cluster. Updates kubeconfig, creates an EKS access entry for your IAM principal, and associates the cluster admin policy. Handles assumed roles automatically.

```bash
gco stacks access [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--cluster` | `-c` | Cluster name (default: `<project_name>-<region>`) |
| `--region` | `-r` | AWS region (default: first deployment region) |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco stacks access                             # Auto-detect region from cdk.json
gco stacks access -r us-west-2                # Specific region
gco stacks access -c my-cluster -r eu-west-1  # Custom cluster name
```

The access entry this creates is required even when you reach a PRIVATE
endpoint through `gco cluster tunnel` — the tunnel solves reachability,
not authentication. `gco cluster doctor` reports which of the two is
actually missing. Deploy-time alternative: declare principals in
`cdk.json` `eks_cluster.developer_access` for namespace-scoped grants
(see [CUSTOMIZATION.md](CUSTOMIZATION.md#eks-cluster-configuration)).

#### `gco stacks eks`

EKS cluster access configuration in cdk.json. Synth-time only: nothing
changes on AWS until the next `gco stacks deploy`, and `gco stacks status`
reports the configured-vs-live endpoint as config drift until then.

```bash
gco stacks eks endpoint set MODE [OPTIONS]
```

**Subcommands:**

- `endpoint set` - Set `eks_cluster.endpoint_access` to `PRIVATE` or
  `PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE`. Widening to `PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE` **requires at least
  one `--cidr`** — the command refuses to open the control plane without an
  explicit allowlist, and an internet-open endpoint must be spelled out as
  `--cidr 0.0.0.0/0`. Setting `PRIVATE` needs no CIDRs (a stored allowlist is
  preserved for a later flip back).

**Options (`endpoint set`):**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--cidr` | | Public-endpoint CIDR allowlist entry (repeatable). Required for `PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE`. |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco stacks eks endpoint set PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE --cidr 203.0.113.7/32   # dev access from one IP
gco stacks eks endpoint set PRIVATE -y                                  # back to production posture
gco stacks deploy gco-us-east-1 -y                                      # apply the change
```

#### `gco stacks regions`

Manage workload deployment Regions in cdk.json (`context.deployment_regions.regional`) through the managed-config engine: every edit is validated against the same rules CDK synth enforces (SDK-known Regions, one AWS partition), written atomically, idempotent, and audited. Config-only — run `gco stacks deploy` afterwards to apply, and note that removing a Region never destroys its deployed stack.

```bash
gco stacks regions COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

**Subcommands:**

- `list` - Show the configured topology (`gco stacks regions list`): global/API/monitoring Regions, the workload Region list, the resolved partition, and the cdk.json path. On a broken config, `partition_error` explains what synth would reject.
- `add` - Add a workload Region (`gco stacks regions add`); re-adding a present Region is a reported no-op.
- `remove` - Remove a workload Region (`gco stacks regions remove`); the resulting list must stay valid (at least one Region). Removing a typo'd entry from a hand-edited config is allowed — validation applies to the result, so this doubles as the repair path.
- `set` - Set a control-plane Region scalar (`gco stacks regions set <global|api_gateway|monitoring> <region>`); the whole topology must stay in one AWS partition. Already-deployed stacks are not moved or destroyed.

All commands accept `--config-path` to target an explicit cdk.json (useful when running outside a checkout); the mutating ones accept `-y` to skip confirmation.

**Example:**

```bash
gco stacks regions list
gco stacks regions add us-west-2 -y
gco stacks regions remove us-west-2 -y
gco stacks regions set monitoring us-west-2 -y
```

#### `gco stacks bedrock`

Manage the four Bedrock model defaults in `context.bedrock`—Mission, capacity advisor, Claude Code, and Codex—plus the canonical Codex `reasoning_effort`. Every edit uses the managed-config engine, so it is validated, atomic, idempotent, and audited, and it preserves all sibling settings. The Codex model and effort remain independently editable so changing one never replaces the other; review them together when changing model families. See [Autopilot](AUTOPILOT.md#choosing-a-model-and-reasoning) for launch-time precedence and why explicit Codex model overrides omit the canonical effort.

```bash
gco stacks bedrock COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

**Subcommands:**

- `show` - Show all four managed model IDs, the Codex reasoning effort, and their backing cdk.json path (`gco stacks bedrock show`).
- `set-mission-model` - Set the Mission sampling default model/inference-profile ID (`gco stacks bedrock set-mission-model`). IDs are free-form (custom profiles, marketplace models); validation mirrors the runtime reader — a non-empty string without surrounding whitespace.
- `set-capacity-advisor-model` - Set the capacity advisor default model/inference-profile ID (`gco stacks bedrock set-capacity-advisor-model`). Same free-form validation; explicit `--model` overrides still win at run time.
- `set-claude-code-model` - Set the Claude Code session model `gco autopilot` launches with (`gco stacks bedrock set-claude-code-model`). Same free-form validation; explicit `--model`/`GCO_AUTOPILOT_MODEL` overrides still win at launch time.
- `set-codex-model` - Set the canonical Codex session model (`gco stacks bedrock set-codex-model`) while preserving `context.bedrock.codex.reasoning_effort`. Explicit `--model`, `GCO_AUTOPILOT_CODEX_MODEL`, and `GCO_AUTOPILOT_MODEL` overrides still win at launch time.
- `set-codex-reasoning-effort` - Set `context.bedrock.codex.reasoning_effort` to `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh` while preserving the Codex model. This applies only when the canonical Codex model wins resolution.

**Example:**

```bash
gco stacks bedrock show
gco stacks bedrock set-mission-model global.anthropic.claude-opus-5 -y
gco stacks bedrock set-capacity-advisor-model us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0 -y
gco stacks bedrock set-claude-code-model us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6 -y
gco stacks bedrock set-codex-model global.openai.gpt-5.6-sol -y
gco stacks bedrock set-codex-reasoning-effort xhigh -y
```

```bash
gco stacks fsx COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

**Subcommands:**

gco stacks valkey disable -y
```

#### `gco stacks aurora`

Manage Aurora PostgreSQL (pgvector) database.

```bash
gco stacks aurora COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

**Subcommands:**

- `status` - Show Aurora pgvector configuration status
- `enable` - Enable Aurora Serverless v2 with pgvector
- `disable` - Disable Aurora pgvector

**Example:**

```bash
gco stacks aurora status
gco stacks aurora enable --min-acu 2 --max-acu 32 --deletion-protection -y
gco stacks aurora disable -y
```

#### `gco stacks addons`

Inspect and re-converge cluster add-ons (Helm charts). Add-on installation is decoupled from the CloudFormation rollback path, so a chart that fails to install never rolls back the cluster.

```bash
gco stacks addons COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

**Subcommands:**

- `status` - Show per-chart add-on install status (read from SSM)
- `install` - Re-run the Helm add-on installer (idempotent; never rolls back the cluster)

**Options (both subcommands):**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | AWS region (default: first deployment region) |
| `--all-regions` | `-A` | Apply across all deployment regions |

**Example:**

```bash
gco stacks addons status
gco stacks addons status --all-regions
gco stacks addons install -r us-west-2
```

#### `gco stacks synth`

Synthesize CloudFormation templates without deploying.

```bash
gco stacks synth [STACK_NAME] [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**

- `STACK_NAME` - Optional stack name; omit to synthesize all stacks

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--quiet` | `-q` | Suppress synthesis output |

**Example:**

```bash
gco stacks synth                           # synthesize all
gco stacks synth gco-us-east-1
gco stacks synth -q                        # quiet mode
```

#### `gco stacks diff`

Show differences between deployed and local stacks.

```bash
gco stacks diff [STACK_NAME]
```

**Arguments:**

- `STACK_NAME` - Optional stack name; omit to diff all stacks

**Example:**

```bash
gco stacks diff
gco stacks diff gco-us-east-1
```

#### `gco stacks outputs`

Get CloudFormation outputs from a deployed stack (e.g. API URLs, ARNs,
secret references that the stack exposes).

```bash
gco stacks outputs STACK_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | AWS region (required) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco stacks outputs gco-us-east-1 -r us-east-1
gco stacks outputs gco-global -r us-east-2
```

### DAG Commands

Run multi-step job pipelines with dependencies. Define a DAG in YAML, and GCO runs steps in dependency order, skipping downstream steps if a dependency fails.

<details>
<summary>All <code>gco dag</code> commands (2) — click to expand</summary>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`gco dag run`](#gco-dag-run) | Execute a DAG pipeline. |
| [`gco dag validate`](#gco-dag-validate) | Validate a DAG definition without running it. |

</details>

#### `gco dag run`

Execute a DAG pipeline.

```bash
gco dag run DAG_FILE [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Region to run in (default: from DAG file or first deployed) |
| `--timeout` | `-t` | Timeout per step in seconds (default: 3600) |
| `--dry-run` | | Validate and show execution order without running |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Run a pipeline
gco dag run pipeline.yaml -r us-east-1

# Preview execution order
gco dag run pipeline.yaml --dry-run
```

#### `gco dag validate`

Validate a DAG definition without running it. Checks for cycles, missing dependencies, and missing manifest files.

```bash
gco dag validate DAG_FILE
```

**Example:**

```bash
gco dag validate examples/pipeline-dag.yaml
```

#### DAG File Format

```yaml
name: my-pipeline
region: us-east-1          # optional, auto-detects if omitted
namespace: gco-jobs    # optional, defaults to gco-jobs

steps:
  - name: preprocess
    manifest: examples/preprocess-job.yaml

  - name: train
    manifest: examples/train-job.yaml
    depends_on: [preprocess]

  - name: evaluate
    manifest: examples/evaluate-job.yaml
    depends_on: [train]
```

Steps without `depends_on` run first. Steps with dependencies wait until all dependencies succeed. If a step fails, all downstream steps are automatically skipped.

Use shared EFS storage (`/mnt/shared`) to pass data between steps.

### Costs Commands

View cost breakdowns and estimates for GCO resources. Uses AWS Cost Explorer filtered by the `Project: GCO` tag applied to all resources.

**Setup (one-time):** To filter costs by the `Project` tag, you must activate cost allocation tags in your AWS account. The CLI can do this for you:

```bash
gco costs allocation status    # check what is active
gco costs allocation activate  # activate Project + aws:eks:cluster-name
```

See [`gco costs allocation`](#gco-costs-allocation) for details. Alternatively, activate manually:

1. Go to the [AWS Billing Console → Cost Allocation Tags](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/tags)
2. Search for the `Project` tag under "User-defined cost allocation tags"
3. Select it and click "Activate"
4. Wait ~24 hours for tag data to appear in Cost Explorer

Until the tag is activated, use `--all` to see total account costs:

```bash
gco costs summary --all
```

You can also activate the `Environment` and `Owner` tags for more granular filtering (`gco costs allocation activate -t Environment -t Owner`, or in the console).

#### `gco costs summary`

Show total GCO spend broken down by AWS service.

```bash
gco costs summary [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |

```bash
gco costs regions [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|

gco costs trend
gco costs trend --days 7
gco costs trend --all
```

#### `gco costs workloads`

Estimate costs for currently running workloads (jobs and inference endpoints) based on instance pricing and runtime.

```bash
gco costs workloads [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|

# All regions
gco costs workloads

# Specific region
gco costs workloads -r us-east-1
```

#### `gco costs forecast`

Forecast GCO costs for the next N days based on historical spending patterns.

```bash
gco costs forecast [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--days` | `-d` | Days to forecast ahead (default: 30) |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco costs forecast
gco costs forecast --days 60
```

> **Note:** Cost Explorer needs at least 14 days of historical data to generate forecasts.

#### `gco costs allocation`

Manage the cost allocation tags behind `gco costs` reporting. Every `gco costs` query filters on the `Project` tag, which only sees spend once the tag key is activated as a cost allocation tag in the billing account. The AWS-generated `aws:eks:cluster-name` key adds per-cluster attribution for the EC2 capacity EKS Auto Mode launches outside CloudFormation.

```bash
gco costs allocation COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

In an AWS Organization, activation requires the management (payer) account — member accounts get an access error. Tag keys only become activatable after AWS observes them on billed usage, which can take up to 24 hours after first deployment.

#### `gco costs allocation status`

Show activation status for GCO's cost allocation tag keys: the user-defined `Project` tag and the AWS-generated `aws:eks:cluster-name` tag by default, plus any extra keys passed with `--tag`. Also lists recent backfill requests when any exist.

```bash
gco costs allocation status [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--tag` | `-t` | Additional tag key to check (repeatable) |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco costs allocation status
gco costs allocation status -t Environment -t Owner
gco --output json costs allocation status
```

Keys reported as **Not found** have not yet appeared on billed usage (deploy first, then allow up to 24 hours); **Inactive** keys exist and can be activated.

#### `gco costs allocation activate`

Activate GCO's cost allocation tag keys in the billing account. Activates the `Project` tag (user-defined) and `aws:eks:cluster-name` (AWS-generated) by default. Activation is reversible in the Billing console and only affects billing data from now on; pass `--backfill-from` to also re-tag past usage.

```bash
gco costs allocation activate [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--tag` | `-t` | Additional tag key to activate (repeatable) |
| `--backfill-from` | | Also re-tag historical usage from this date (YYYY-MM-DD, up to 12 months back; Billing aligns it to a quarter start) |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip the confirmation prompt |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco costs allocation activate
gco costs allocation activate --backfill-from 2026-01-01
gco costs allocation activate -t Environment -y
```

After activation, allow up to 24 hours before tag data appears in Cost Explorer. Keys that fail with "not found" have not appeared on billed usage yet — deploy first, then retry.

#### `gco costs k8s`

Query Kubernetes allocation costs across regions. These commands run [Amazon Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html) aggregations over the [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/) allocation reports the per-region cost-monitor services write to the central cost report bucket. Requires `cost_monitoring.enabled` in `cdk.json` (the default) and a deployed monitoring stack — see [docs/COST_MONITORING.md](COST_MONITORING.md).

```bash
gco costs k8s COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

#### `gco costs k8s namespaces`

Show Kubernetes cost by namespace across all regions, broken down into CPU, RAM, GPU, and persistent volume cost.

```bash
gco costs k8s namespaces [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--days` | `-d` | Days to look back (default: 7) |
| `--region` | `-r` | Restrict to one deployment region |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco costs k8s namespaces
gco costs k8s namespaces --days 30
gco costs k8s namespaces -r us-east-1
```

#### `gco costs k8s regions`

Show Kubernetes allocation cost by deployment region.

```bash
gco costs k8s regions [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--days` | `-d` | Days to look back (default: 7) |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco costs k8s regions
gco costs k8s regions --days 30
```

#### `gco costs k8s trend`

Show Kubernetes cost over time.

```bash
gco costs k8s trend [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--days` | `-d` | Days to look back (default: 14) |
| `--granularity` | | Trend bucket size: `daily` (default) or `hourly` |
| `--namespace` | `-n` | Restrict to one namespace |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco costs k8s trend
gco costs k8s trend --days 30 --granularity daily
gco costs k8s trend -n gco-jobs --granularity hourly --days 2
```

#### `gco costs k8s top`

Show the top-N spenders by namespace, region, or cluster.

```bash
gco costs k8s top [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--limit` | `-n` | Number of results (default: 10) |
| `--by` | | Grouping dimension: `namespace` (default), `region`, or `cluster` |
| `--days` | `-d` | Days to look back (default: 7) |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco costs k8s top
gco costs k8s top -n 5 --by region
gco costs k8s top --by cluster --days 30
```

#### `gco costs report`

Generate and list OpenCost allocation reports through the authenticated GCO API (`/api/v1/cost/*`).

```bash
gco costs report COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

Passing `--region` pins the request to that region's API bridge (each region's cost monitor owns its own OpenCost data); in the commercial partition direct bridge access requires `api_gateway.regional_api_enabled=true`. Without `--region` the request rides the global API and is served by the nearest healthy region — the response names the region that answered.

#### `gco costs report generate`

Generate an ad-hoc cost report now. The report is written under the `adhoc/` prefix in the cost report bucket (kept out of the scheduled Athena table so overlapping windows never double-count) and its summary is returned.

```bash
gco costs report generate [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Region whose cost monitor generates the report |
| `--window-hours` | | Trailing window the report covers, 1-168 (default: 24) |
| `--show-rows` | | Print the allocation rows in the response |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco costs report generate
gco costs report generate -r us-east-1 --window-hours 48
gco costs report generate --show-rows
```

#### `gco costs report list`

List recent cost report objects in the cost report bucket.

```bash
gco costs report list [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Region whose reports to list |
| `--adhoc` | | List ad-hoc instead of scheduled reports |
| `--limit` | `-l` | Maximum results, 1-1000 (default: 20) |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco costs report list
gco costs report list -r us-east-1 --limit 50
gco costs report list --adhoc
```

#### `gco costs report status`

Show cost monitoring health for a region: OpenCost liveness, whether it is returning allocation data, the report bucket, cadence, and the last scheduled report.

```bash
gco costs report status [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Region whose cost monitor to check |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco costs report status
gco costs report status -r us-east-1
```

#### `gco costs dashboard`

Open a regional cost dashboard over the private EKS endpoint. `--service grafana` (the default) port-forwards to the in-cluster Grafana and prints the direct URL of the GCO Cost dashboard; `--service opencost` forwards the native OpenCost UI. Runs in the foreground; press Ctrl-C to stop. Accepts the same `--via-ssm` tunnel options as [`gco monitoring open`](#gco-monitoring-open).

```bash
gco costs dashboard [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--service` | | `grafana` (default) or `opencost` |
| `--region` | | Cluster region (defaults to the first cdk.json regional entry) |
| `--local-port` | | Local port to bind (defaults per-service) |
| `--via-ssm` | | Tunnel through an SSM-managed instance: an instance id, or `auto` |
| `--bastion-ttl-minutes` | | Self-terminate backstop for an `auto` bastion (default: 120) |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip the confirmation prompt when provisioning an `auto` bastion |

**Examples:**

```bash
gco costs dashboard
gco costs dashboard --service opencost --region us-east-1
gco costs dashboard --via-ssm auto -y
```

#### `gco capacity check`

Check capacity for a specific instance type.

```bash
gco capacity check [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--instance-type` | `-i` | Instance type to check |
| `--region` | `-r` | Region to check |
| `--type` | `-t` | Capacity type: `spot`, `on-demand`, or `both` |
| `--enrich-historical` | | Append historical capacity context to the output (requires historical.enabled) |

```

#### `gco capacity status`

View capacity status across regions.

```bash
gco capacity status [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Filter by region |

#### `gco capacity recommend`

Get capacity recommendation for an instance type.

```bash
gco capacity recommend [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--instance-type` | `-i` | Instance type |
| `--region` | `-r` | Region |

#### `gco capacity recommend-region`

Get optimal region recommendation.

```bash
gco capacity recommend-region [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--gpu` | | Recommend for GPU workloads |
| `--instance-type` | `-i` | Specific instance type (enables weighted scoring) |
| `--gpu-count` | | Number of GPUs required |
| `--min-gpus` | | Minimum GPUs required |

When `--instance-type` is provided, the recommendation uses weighted multi-signal
scoring that combines spot placement scores, spot-vs-on-demand pricing, queue depth,
GPU utilization, and running job counts. Without it, a simpler composite score is used.

**Example:**

```bash
gco capacity recommend-region --gpu
gco capacity recommend-region -i g5.xlarge
gco capacity recommend-region -i p4d.24xlarge --gpu-count 8
```

#### `gco capacity ai-recommend`

Get AI-powered capacity recommendation using Amazon Bedrock.

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**: Recommendations are AI-generated and should be validated before making production decisions. Capacity availability and pricing can change rapidly.

```bash
gco capacity ai-recommend [OPTIONS]
```

This command gathers comprehensive capacity data including:

- Spot placement scores, pricing, and 7-day per-AZ price trends across regions
- On-demand availability and pricing
- Capacity Reservations (ODCRs), Capacity Block offerings, and 26-week
  block-availability trends
- Current cluster utilization (queue depth, GPU/CPU usage)
- Running and pending job counts
- The algorithmic multi-signal region ranking as advisory context

Without `--instance-type`, one representative type per current GPU generation
is scanned (T4, L4, A10G, L40S, RTX PRO 4500/6000 Blackwell, A100, H100, H200,
B200, B300).

The data is analyzed by the Bedrock model selected by `cdk.json`
`context.bedrock.capacity_advisor_default_model_id` (Anthropic Claude Opus 5's
global inference profile in the stock configuration). The stock
`context.bedrock.generation_reasoning.effort=high` runs Claude adaptive thinking at its
default effort; reasoning tokens are billed as output and can materially
increase latency. Explicit model overrides do not inherit the default's
thinking fields.

**Requirements:**

- AWS credentials with `bedrock:InvokeModel` permission
- The specified Bedrock model must be enabled in your account

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--workload` | `-w` | Description of your workload |
| `--instance-type` | `-i` | Instance types to consider (can specify multiple) |
| `--region` | `-r` | Regions to consider (can specify multiple) |
| `--gpu` | | Workload requires GPUs |
| `--min-gpus` | | Minimum GPUs required |
| `--min-memory-gb` | | Minimum memory in GB |
| `--fault-tolerance` | `-f` | Fault tolerance level: `high`, `medium`, `low` |
| `--max-cost` | | Maximum cost per hour in USD |
| `--model` | `-m` | Bedrock model ID to use (default: `cdk.json` `context.bedrock.capacity_advisor_default_model_id`) |
| `--raw` | | Show raw AI response |

**Example:**

```bash
# Basic recommendation
gco capacity ai-recommend --workload "Training a large language model"

# GPU workload with specific requirements
gco capacity ai-recommend -w "Inference workload" --gpu --min-gpus 4

# Compare specific instance types and regions
gco capacity ai-recommend -i g5.xlarge -i g5.2xlarge -r us-east-1 -r us-west-2

# Cost-constrained recommendation
gco capacity ai-recommend --fault-tolerance high --max-cost 5.00

# Use a different model
gco capacity ai-recommend -w "ML training" --model us.anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0
```

#### `gco capacity reservations`

List On-Demand Capacity Reservations (ODCRs) across deployed regions.

```bash
gco capacity reservations [OPTIONS]
```

```

#### `gco capacity reservation-check`

Check reservation availability and Capacity Block offerings for ML workloads. Checks both existing ODCRs and purchasable Capacity Blocks (guaranteed GPU capacity for a fixed duration at a known price). Pass `--region` more than once to check several regions in parallel, and use `--earliest-start`/`--latest-start` to ask for blocks starting near a date. For a full duration-range sweep that returns one consolidated ranked report, use [`gco capacity find-blocks`](#gco-capacity-find-blocks).

```bash
gco capacity reservation-check [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-i, --instance-type` | Instance type to check (required) |
| `-r, --region` | Region(s) to check; repeatable (default: all deployed regions) |
| `-c, --count` | Minimum instances needed (default: 1) |
| `--include-blocks/--no-blocks` | Include Capacity Block offerings (default: yes) |
| `--block-duration` | Capacity Block duration in hours (default: 24) |
| `--block-duration-days` | Capacity Block duration in days (overrides `--block-duration`) |
| `--earliest-start` | Earliest block start date (`YYYY-MM-DD` or ISO datetime) |
| `--latest-start` | Latest block start date (`YYYY-MM-DD` or ISO datetime) |

```bash
# Check for p5.48xlarge reservations and block offerings
gco capacity reservation-check -i p5.48xlarge

# Check with specific count and duration
gco capacity reservation-check -i p4d.24xlarge -c 2 --block-duration 48

# ODCRs only, no block offerings
gco capacity reservation-check -i g5.48xlarge -r us-east-1 --no-blocks

# Two regions, a 14-day block starting on/after a date
gco capacity reservation-check -i p5.48xlarge -r us-east-1 -r us-west-2 \
  --block-duration-days 14 --earliest-start 2026-07-01
```

#### `gco capacity find-blocks`

Find EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML across regions, durations, and a start-date window in a single call. One command fans out across every requested region and every valid Capacity Block duration in the range (in parallel), then returns one consolidated, de-duplicated, ranked report — cheapest per-GPU-hour first — with per-hour and per-GPU-hour pricing and the longest available block. This replaces the manual multi-call sweeping the older `reservation-check` required to bound "where and when can I get this GPU for N days?".

```bash
gco capacity find-blocks [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-i, --instance-type` | GPU instance type or friendly alias, e.g. `p6-b200` (required) |
| `-r, --region` | Region(s) to search; repeatable (default: all deployed regions) |
| `-c, --count` | Instances per block (default: 1) |
| `--duration-days` | Single target duration in days |
| `--duration-hours` | Single target duration in hours |
| `--min-duration-days` / `--max-duration-days` | Duration range bounds, in days |
| `--min-duration-hours` / `--max-duration-hours` | Duration range bounds, in hours |
| `--earliest-start` | Earliest block start (`YYYY-MM-DD` or ISO datetime) |
| `--latest-start` | Latest block start (`YYYY-MM-DD` or ISO datetime) |
| `--find-longest` | Sweep the duration ladder and surface the longest available block |

**Allowed Capacity Block durations.** AWS accepts reservation durations in **1-day increments up to 14 days, then 7-day increments up to 182 days** (26 weeks). Because the `DescribeCapacityBlockOfferings` API requires an exact duration per query, a duration *range* is expanded to those discrete valid values automatically (e.g. `1`–`63` days probes 1…14, 21, 28, …, 63 days). All Capacity Blocks end at 11:30 UTC, so a returned block's actual duration is the closest valid match to your request and is reported per offering.

**Instance-type notes.** Friendly names are normalized (`p6-b200` → `p6-b200.48xlarge`, `p6-b300` → `p6-b300.48xlarge`). Both B200 and B300 (Blackwell Ultra) are standalone EC2 instance types and resolve normally. The Grace-Blackwell **GB200/GB300** NVL72 *superchips* ship only as **P6e-GB200 / P6e-GB300 UltraServers** (never as a standalone `InstanceType`), so those names are flagged with guidance toward the UltraServer flow rather than silently returning nothing. Unknown/typo'd types are reported as invalid (distinct from a valid type that simply has zero offerings).

```bash
# Bound the motivating scenario in a single call:
gco capacity find-blocks -i p6-b200.48xlarge \
  -r us-east-1 -r us-east-2 -r us-west-2 -r eu-west-1 \
  --min-duration-days 1 --max-duration-days 63 \
  --earliest-start 2026-07-01 --latest-start 2026-07-10

# A single 14-day block in one region
gco capacity find-blocks -i p5.48xlarge -r us-east-1 --duration-days 14

# Longest block available in the next window
gco capacity find-blocks -i p5.48xlarge -r us-east-1 --find-longest

# JSON for scripting (consolidated report with ranked offerings)
gco --output json capacity find-blocks -i p6-b200 -r us-east-1 --max-duration-days 7
```

#### `gco capacity reserve`

Purchase a Capacity Block offering by ID. Use `gco capacity reservation-check`
first to find available offerings, then pass the `cb-...` ID to this
command. Always validate with `--dry-run` before committing — Capacity
Block purchases incur charges.

```bash
gco capacity reserve [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--offering-id` | `-o` | Capacity Block offering ID (`cb-…`) (required) |
| `--region` | `-r` | AWS region where the offering exists (required) |
| `--dry-run` | | Validate the offering without purchasing |

**Example:**

```bash
# Find offerings, validate, then purchase
gco capacity reservation-check -i p4d.24xlarge -r us-east-1
gco capacity reserve -o cb-0123456789abcdef0 -r us-east-1 --dry-run
gco capacity reserve -o cb-0123456789abcdef0 -r us-east-1
```

#### `gco capacity find-reservations`

Find existing On-Demand Capacity Reservations (ODCRs) across regions in one call — the ODCR counterpart to [`gco capacity find-blocks`](#gco-capacity-find-blocks). Fans out across every requested region in parallel, normalizes friendly instance-type aliases (`p6-b200` → `p6-b200.48xlarge`), enriches each reservation with On-Demand pricing, and returns one consolidated report ranked most-available-first (then cheapest per-GPU-hour).

```bash
gco capacity find-reservations [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-i, --instance-type` | Instance type or alias to filter by (e.g. `p6-b200`); omit for all types |
| `-r, --region` | Region(s) to search; repeatable (default: all deployed regions) |
| `-c, --count` | Minimum available instances to consider the search satisfied (default: 1) |
| `--state` | Reservation state filter (default: `active`; use `all` for any state) |
| `--pricing/--no-pricing` | Enrich reservations with On-Demand pricing (default: yes) |

```bash
# Where do I already have free p5 reserved capacity?
gco capacity find-reservations -i p5.48xlarge

# Two regions, alias normalization, no pricing lookups
gco capacity find-reservations -i p6-b200 -r us-east-1 -r us-west-2 --no-pricing
```

#### `gco capacity create-reservation`

Create a new On-Demand Capacity Reservation (ODCR) — the ODCR counterpart to [`gco capacity reserve`](#gco-capacity-reserve). Reserves On-Demand capacity for an instance type in a specific Availability Zone. **Charges accrue** for the reserved capacity whether or not it is used, until the reservation is cancelled. Always validate with `--dry-run` first.

```bash
gco capacity create-reservation [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--instance-type` | `-i` | EC2 instance type or alias (required) |
| `--region` | `-r` | AWS region (required) |
| `--availability-zone` | `-z` | Target Availability Zone, e.g. `us-east-1a` (required) |
| `--count` | `-c` | Number of instances to reserve (default: 1) |
| `--platform` | | Instance platform/OS (default: `Linux/UNIX`) |
| `--tenancy` | | `default` or `dedicated` (default: `default`) |
| `--match-criteria` | | `open` or `targeted` (default: `open`) |
| `--end-date` | | Optional end date (`YYYY-MM-DD` or ISO); omit for an unlimited reservation |
| `--ebs-optimized` | | Reserve EBS-optimized capacity |
| `--dry-run` | | Validate the request without creating (no cost) |

```bash
# Validate, then create
gco capacity create-reservation -i p5.48xlarge -r us-east-1 -z us-east-1a -c 2 --dry-run
gco capacity create-reservation -i p5.48xlarge -r us-east-1 -z us-east-1a -c 2
```

#### `gco capacity cancel-reservation`

Cancel an On-Demand Capacity Reservation, releasing its capacity so it stops incurring On-Demand charges. Only ODCRs can be cancelled this way; a Capacity Block runs for its fixed term. Instances already running against the reservation are not terminated — they revert to normal On-Demand billing.

```bash
gco capacity cancel-reservation [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--reservation-id` | `-o` | Capacity Reservation ID (`cr-…`) to cancel (required) |
| `--region` | `-r` | AWS region where the reservation exists (required) |
| `--dry-run` | | Validate the cancellation without cancelling |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation |

```bash
gco capacity cancel-reservation -o cr-0123456789abcdef0 -r us-east-1 --dry-run
gco capacity cancel-reservation -o cr-0123456789abcdef0 -r us-east-1 -y
```

#### `gco capacity instance-info`

Describe an instance type's compute characteristics. Read-only — it calls
`ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes` and never `RunInstances`.

Resolved live on every call. There is deliberately no checked-in specification
table behind this, so a newly launched accelerator family is reported the day it
ships. (One used to exist — a 25-entry GPU catalog that short-circuited the API —
and it was removed because a hand-maintained catalog hides new families until
someone edits it, and a stale number feeds straight into NodePool sizing and
capacity scores.)

Reported fields:

| Group | Fields |
|-------|--------|
| Processor | vCPUs, cores, threads per core, architectures, sustained clock speed, manufacturer, current-generation and bare-metal flags, hypervisor, burstable |
| Accelerators | NVIDIA GPUs (per-model name, manufacturer, count, memory) with the node total; AWS Neuron devices with core counts; Inferentia; media accelerators; FPGAs |
| Network | EFA support and max EFA interfaces, network performance, max ENIs and network cards, IPv6, ENA, encryption in transit |
| Storage | local NVMe total and per-disk layout, EBS optimized/encryption/NVMe support, baseline and maximum EBS IOPS and throughput |
| Purchasing | supported usage classes (on-demand / spot / capacity-block), placement-group strategies, dedicated-host support |
| Platform | root device and virtualization types, boot modes, hibernation, auto-recovery, Nitro Enclaves, Nitro TPM |

GPU memory is reported as the **total** across devices, with the per-device
figure in `gpu_devices`.

`DescribeInstanceTypes` is region-scoped: a type is described only where it is
offered. If it is missing, try another region or
[`gco capacity recommend-region`](#gco-capacity-recommend-region).

```bash
gco capacity instance-info INSTANCE_TYPE [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Region to describe the type in (default: the configured default region) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco capacity instance-info g5.xlarge
gco capacity instance-info p5.48xlarge
gco capacity instance-info trn2.48xlarge --region us-east-1

# Machine-readable, for a specific field
gco -o json capacity instance-info p5.48xlarge | jq '.gpu_devices'
gco -o json capacity instance-info p5.48xlarge | jq '{efa: .efa_supported, gpus: .gpu_count}'
```

#### `gco capacity spot-prices`

Get spot price history for an instance type in a region.

```bash
gco capacity spot-prices [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--instance-type` | `-i` | EC2 instance type (required) |
| `--region` | `-r` | AWS region (required) |
| `--days` | `-d` | Days of history to retrieve |

**Example:**

```bash
gco capacity spot-prices -i g5.xlarge -r us-east-1
gco capacity spot-prices -i p4d.24xlarge -r us-west-2 -d 30
```

#### `gco capacity history`

Query the historical capacity surface, an optional add-on to the global stack (not a separate stack) that is enabled by default. Set `historical.enabled` to `false` in cdk.json to opt out. The poller writes time-series snapshots to DynamoDB; when none are available yet the subcommands print a clear notice.

Spot placement scores are collected per *instance pool* (a reviewed set of interchangeable types; the snapshot's `spot_pool` attribute names it) at each configured target capacity, because the underlying AWS API needs at least three instance types to return a meaningful score. Snapshots recorded before pooled collection used single-type requests whose scores are artificially depressed and are not comparable with pooled values; see the [capacity poller README](../lambda/capacity-poller/README.md#history-discontinuity).

#### `gco capacity history show`

Show the recorded capacity time-series (pooled spot placement scores at each configured target capacity, spot price, AZ coverage, queue depth, capacity-block availability) for an instance type in a region. Columns follow the store's metric registry, so newly configured metrics appear automatically.

```bash
gco capacity history show [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--instance-type` | `-i` | EC2 instance type (required) |
| `--region` | `-r` | AWS region (required) |
| `--hours` | `-H` | Hours of history to show (default 168 = 7 days) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco capacity history show -i g5.xlarge -r us-east-1
gco capacity history show -i p5.48xlarge -r us-east-1 -H 72
```

#### `gco capacity history stats`

Show a statistical summary (p25/p50/p75, min, max, mean, stddev) for each metric over the window.

```bash
gco capacity history stats [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--instance-type` | `-i` | EC2 instance type (required) |
| `--region` | `-r` | AWS region (required) |
| `--hours` | `-H` | Hours of history to summarize (default 168 = 7 days) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco capacity history stats -i g5.xlarge -r us-east-1
```

#### `gco capacity history patterns`

Show a day-of-week by hour heatmap grid of a metric's historical averages (default: the pooled spot placement score at target capacity 1), plus the best historical windows.

```bash
gco capacity history patterns [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--instance-type` | `-i` | EC2 instance type (required) |
| `--region` | `-r` | AWS region (required) |
| `--hours` | `-H` | Hours of history to analyze (default 168 = 7 days) |
| `--metric` | `-m` | Metric to aggregate (default `spot_score`); accepts any recorded metric field, including the per-target-capacity scores `spot_score_at_10` and `spot_score_at_50` |

**Example:**

```bash
gco capacity history patterns -i g5.xlarge -r us-east-1
gco capacity history patterns -i p5.48xlarge -r us-east-1 -m spot_score_at_10
```

#### `gco capacity traffic-dial`

Inspect and control Global Accelerator traffic dials (commercial `aws`
partition only). Each workload region's endpoint group has a
`TrafficDialPercentage`: the share of new connections Global Accelerator
admits to that region relative to optimal routing, with the remainder
redirected to the next-closest region. The optional scheduled controller
(`global_accelerator.traffic_dial` in `cdk.json`, see
[CUSTOMIZATION.md](CUSTOMIZATION.md#traffic-dial-controller)) converges dials
from each cluster's health signal; these commands read its state and provide
the manual escape hatch.

```bash
gco capacity traffic-dial [COMMAND]
```

#### `gco capacity traffic-dial show`

Show each region's current dial, endpoint health, any manual override, and
the scheduled controller's last decision (reason plus the observed healthy
percent). The controller line reports its mode (`monitor` or `enforce`) and
last run time.

```bash
gco capacity traffic-dial show
```

**Example:**

```bash
gco capacity traffic-dial show
gco capacity traffic-dial show --output json   # via the global --output flag
```

#### `gco capacity traffic-dial set`

Manually dial `REGION` to `PERCENTAGE` (0-100) and record an override the
scheduled controller honors: the region is left alone until the override is
cleared. Applies `UpdateEndpointGroup` carrying only the dial, so the
registered ALB endpoint is untouched. Prompts for confirmation unless
`--yes` is passed; changes apply to new connections only and converge to the
accelerator's edge locations over a few minutes. Warns when the change would
leave no fully dialed region on the listener.

```bash
gco capacity traffic-dial set REGION PERCENTAGE [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip the confirmation prompt |

**Example:**

```bash
gco capacity traffic-dial set us-west-2 20 --yes   # drain to 20% for maintenance
gco capacity traffic-dial set us-west-2 100        # restore full dial
```

#### `gco capacity traffic-dial clear`

Clear `REGION`'s manual override so the scheduled controller resumes managing
it. The dial itself is left unchanged: with the controller disabled or in
`monitor` mode it keeps the last manual value; in `enforce` mode the
controller re-converges it from the region's health signal on its next cycle.

```bash
gco capacity traffic-dial clear REGION
```

**Example:**

```bash
gco capacity traffic-dial clear us-west-2
```

#### `gco capacity predict`

Predict the best time to acquire capacity from historical patterns using Amazon
Bedrock. Combines the historical capacity surface (an optional add-on to the
global stack, enabled by default) with an LLM to recommend the day/hour windows
with the best spot availability and pricing, and which windows to avoid.
Requires collected history. Pass `--all-regions` to run the prediction for every
region that has data for the instance type instead of a single `--region`.

```bash
gco capacity predict [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--instance-type` | `-i` | EC2 instance type (required) |
| `--region` | `-r` | AWS region (omit when using `--all-regions`) |
| `--all-regions` | `-a` | Predict across every region that has historical data for the instance type |
| `--hours` | `-H` | Hours of history to analyze (default 168 = 7 days) |
| `--model` | `-m` | Bedrock model ID to use (default: `cdk.json` `context.bedrock.capacity_advisor_default_model_id`) |
| `--raw` | | Show the raw AI response |

**Example:**

```bash
gco capacity predict -i p5.48xlarge -r us-east-1
gco capacity predict -i g5.xlarge -r us-west-2 -H 336
gco capacity predict -i g5.xlarge --all-regions
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation |

**Example:**

```bash
gco inference stop my-llm -y
```

#### `gco inference start`

Start a stopped inference endpoint.

```bash
gco inference start ENDPOINT_NAME
```

**Example:**

```bash
gco inference start my-llm
```

#### `gco inference delete`

Delete an inference endpoint from all regions. The first request creates an immutable deletion generation and historical cleanup-region snapshot; repeated requests are idempotent. Regional monitors acknowledge stable full Kubernetes absence for that generation before the conditioned DynamoDB purge.

```bash
gco inference delete ENDPOINT_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation |

**Example:**

```bash
gco inference delete my-llm -y
```

#### `gco inference update-image`

Update the container image for an endpoint. Triggers a rolling update across all target regions.

```bash
gco inference update-image ENDPOINT_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--image` | `-i` | New container image (required) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco inference update-image my-llm -i vllm/vllm-openai:v0.28.0
```

#### `gco inference invoke`

Send a request to an inference endpoint via the API Gateway. Auto-detects the framework (vLLM, TGI, Triton) and builds the appropriate request body.

```bash
gco inference invoke ENDPOINT_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**

- `ENDPOINT_NAME` - Name of the inference endpoint

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--prompt` | `-p` | Text prompt to send |
| `--data` | `-d` | Raw JSON body (overrides --prompt) |
| `--path` | | API sub-path (default: auto-detected from image) |
| `--region` | `-r` | Target region for the request |
| `--max-tokens` | | Max tokens to generate (default: 100) |
| `--stream/--no-stream` | | Enable or disable incremental response streaming; when omitted, raw JSON with `"stream": true` enables it automatically |

`--stream` forces the OpenAI-compatible `"stream": true` field and prints bytes
as they arrive. `--no-stream` forces buffered model output even if raw JSON asks
for streaming. TGI streaming automatically uses `/generate_stream`; request
bodies remain buffered because API Gateway supports response streaming only.

**Example:**

```bash
# Simple prompt (auto-detects vLLM OpenAI-compatible format)
gco inference invoke my-llm -p "What is GPU orchestration?"

# With max tokens
gco inference invoke my-llm -p "Explain Kubernetes" --max-tokens 200

# Raw JSON body
gco inference invoke my-llm -d '{"prompt": "Hello", "max_tokens": 50}'

# Stream OpenAI-compatible output incrementally
gco inference invoke my-llm -p "Hello" --stream

# Raw JSON can opt in automatically when the explicit flag is omitted
gco inference invoke my-llm -d '{"prompt": "Hello", "stream": true}'

# Explicit API path
gco inference invoke my-llm -p "Hello" --path /v1/chat/completions
```

#### `gco inference health`

Check if an inference endpoint is healthy and ready to serve requests. Hits the endpoint's health check path and reports HTTP status and round-trip latency.

```bash
gco inference health ENDPOINT_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**

- `ENDPOINT_NAME` - Name of the inference endpoint

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Target region to check |

**Example:**

```bash
# Check health (nearest region via Global Accelerator)
gco inference health my-llm

# Check health in a specific region
gco inference health my-llm -r us-east-1
```

#### `gco inference models`

Read the loaded model identity through the authenticated endpoint route. vLLM uses the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models`; TGI uses the read-only `/info` contract and reports both model ID and revision. The persisted `--framework` from deploy is used by default.

```bash
gco inference models ENDPOINT_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**

- `ENDPOINT_NAME` - Name of the inference endpoint

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--framework` | | Runtime metadata contract (`vllm` or `tgi`); defaults to the persisted endpoint framework, then vLLM for legacy records. |
| `--region` | `-r` | Target region to query |

**Example:**

```bash
# List loaded models
gco inference models my-llm

# Query a specific region
gco inference models my-llm -r eu-west-1
```

#### `gco inference canary`

Start a canary deployment with a new image. Routes a percentage of traffic to the canary while the primary continues serving the rest.

```bash
gco inference canary ENDPOINT_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--image` | `-i` | New container image for canary (required) |
| `--weight` | `-w` | Percentage of traffic to canary, 1-99 (default: 10) |
| `--replicas` | `-r` | Number of canary replicas (default: 1) |

**Examples:**

```bash
# 10% traffic to new version
gco inference canary my-llm -i vllm/vllm-openai:v0.28.0

# 25% traffic with 2 canary replicas
gco inference canary my-llm -i vllm/vllm-openai:v0.28.0 -w 25 -r 2
```

#### `gco inference promote`

Promote the canary to primary. Replaces the primary image with the canary image and removes the canary deployment. All traffic goes to the new image.

```bash
gco inference promote ENDPOINT_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation |

**Example:**

```bash
gco inference promote my-llm -y
```

#### `gco inference rollback`

Remove the canary deployment, keeping the primary unchanged. All traffic returns to the primary.

```bash
gco inference rollback ENDPOINT_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation |

**Example:**

```bash
gco inference rollback my-llm -y
```

#### `gco inference set-topology`

Resize a disaggregated endpoint's prefill/decode replica counts without redeploying.

```bash
gco inference set-topology ENDPOINT_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--prefill` | | New prefill replica count (required) |
| `--decode` | | New decode replica count (required) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco inference set-topology my-llm --prefill 3 --decode 6
```

#### `gco inference configure-store`

Update the shared KV-cache store on a Mooncake `store`/`both` endpoint. Settings merge onto the endpoint's existing store block and re-trigger reconciliation, so changing one field leaves the others intact.

```bash
gco inference configure-store ENDPOINT_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--cold-tier` / `--no-cold-tier` | Opt the endpoint into (or out of) the async S3 cold tier. Enabling it also enables the shared store it extends |
| `--offload` | KV-store offload tier: `cpu`, `disk`, or `none` |
| `--global-segment-size` | Global segment size in bytes |
| `--local-buffer-size` | Local buffer size in bytes |
| `--enable-store` / `--disable-store` | Enable or disable the shared KV-cache store |

**Example:**

```bash
gco inference configure-store my-llm --cold-tier
gco inference configure-store my-llm --offload cpu --local-buffer-size 2147483648
```

#### `gco inference populate-kv`

Upload data into an endpoint's Mooncake KV-cache cold tier. Objects are written to the region's general-purpose bucket under the `mooncake-kv/<endpoint>/` prefix the endpoint reads from, pre-warming its prefix cache. The endpoint must have the cold tier enabled (`--mooncake-cold-tier` at deploy, or `configure-store --cold-tier`) for its pods to consume the data.

```bash
gco inference populate-kv ENDPOINT_NAME LOCAL_PATH --region REGION
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Region whose general-purpose bucket backs the endpoint's cold tier (required) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco inference populate-kv my-llm ./kv-warm-set/ --region us-east-1
```

### Models Commands

Manage model weights in the central S3 bucket. Models uploaded here are automatically available to inference endpoints across all regions via init container sync.

See [Inference Guide](INFERENCE.md) for details on model weight management.

<details>
<summary>All <code>gco models</code> commands (5) — click to expand</summary>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`gco models upload`](#gco-models-upload) | Upload model weights to the central S3 bucket. |
| [`gco models upload-regional`](#gco-models-upload-regional) | Upload local files or a directory to a region's general-purpose regional bucket (`gco-regional-shared-<account>-<region>`), resolved from that region's own SSM parameter. |
| [`gco models list`](#gco-models-list) | List models in the central S3 bucket. |
| [`gco models delete`](#gco-models-delete) | Permanently delete a model, including all current and historical S3 object versions. |
| [`gco models uri`](#gco-models-uri) | Get the S3 URI for a model (for use with `--model-source` in inference deploy). |

</details>

#### `gco models upload`

Upload model weights to the central S3 bucket.

```bash
gco models upload LOCAL_PATH [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**

- `LOCAL_PATH` - Local file or directory path

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--name` | `-n` | Model name in the registry (required) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco models upload ./my-model-weights/ --name llama3-8b
gco models upload ./weights.safetensors --name my-model
```

#### `gco models upload-regional`

Upload local files or a directory to a region's general-purpose regional bucket (`gco-regional-shared-<account>-<region>`), resolved from that region's own SSM parameter. The bucket is general purpose and usable by any in-region workload; it also backs the Mooncake cold tier. To warm an endpoint's KV cache specifically, prefer `gco inference populate-kv`, which targets the cold-tier key prefix.

```bash
gco models upload-regional LOCAL_PATH --region REGION [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**

- `LOCAL_PATH` - Local file or directory path

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Default | Description |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | | Target region whose regional bucket receives the objects (required) |
| `--prefix` | | `uploads` | S3 key prefix for uploaded objects |

**Example:**

```bash
gco models upload-regional ./data/ --region us-east-1
gco models upload-regional ./file.bin -r eu-west-1 --prefix datasets
```

#### `gco models list`

List models in the central S3 bucket.

```bash
gco models list
```

**Example:**

```bash
gco models list
```

#### `gco models delete`

Permanently delete a model from the versioned central S3 bucket. This removes
all current files, historical object versions, and delete markers beneath the
model prefix; the operation cannot be undone. If S3 reports an error for one
batch, earlier successful deletions remain in effect and the command reports
the failed object versions.

```bash
gco models delete MODEL_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip the permanent-deletion confirmation |

**Example:**

```bash
gco models delete llama3-8b -y
```

#### `gco models uri`

Get the S3 URI for a model (for use with `--model-source` in inference deploy).

```bash
gco models uri MODEL_NAME
```

**Example:**

```bash
gco models uri llama3-8b
# Output: s3://gco-models-xxx/models/llama3-8b
```

---

### Storage Commands

Discover and transfer data between the user-facing S3 buckets created by GCO
and local storage without needing to know generated physical bucket names.
Bucket names are resolved from the SSM parameters and CloudFormation metadata
published by the deployed stacks; GCO does not guess or reconstruct them.

<details>
<summary>All <code>gco storage</code> commands (3) — click to expand</summary>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`gco storage list`](#gco-storage-list) | List deployed user-facing buckets and their stable aliases. |
| [`gco storage s3-inventory`](#gco-storage-s3-inventory) | Describe every S3 bucket the deployment creates, with owning stack, purpose, pod access, and removal policy. |
| [`gco storage sync`](#gco-storage-sync) | Incrementally download from or upload to a bucket or prefix. |

</details>

#### Bucket aliases

| Alias | Scope | Purpose | Discovery source |
|-------|-------|---------|------------------|
| `cluster-shared` | Global | Cross-region cluster job artifacts and shared data | Global-region SSM parameters |
| `model-weights` | Global | Central model weights used by inference endpoints | Global-region SSM parameter |
| `regional-shared:REGION` | Regional | General-purpose data for workloads in one region | That region's SSM parameters |
| `analytics-studio` | Optional analytics region | SageMaker Studio private scratch data and outputs | `PROJECT-analytics` CloudFormation resources |

`regional-shared` is also accepted with `--region REGION`. When exactly one
regional deployment is configured, the region may be omitted; multi-region
deployments must use `--region` or the canonical region-qualified alias. The
four dedicated access-log buckets are intentionally excluded because they are
internal compliance sinks, not workload storage.

#### `gco storage list`

List deployed user-facing buckets with alias, scope, home region, physical name,
purpose, and S3 URI. `--region` limits regional-bucket discovery to one region;
global and optional analytics buckets are still included.

```bash
gco storage list [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Limit regional-bucket discovery to one region |

```bash
gco storage list
gco storage list --region us-east-1
gco --output json storage list
```

#### `gco storage s3-inventory`

Describe **every** S3 bucket the deployment creates, as a JSON document. Broader
than [`gco storage list`](#gco-storage-list), which reports only the four
user-facing buckets addressable by [`gco storage sync`](#gco-storage-sync).

Covers the always-on central [`Cluster_Shared_Bucket`](CLUSTER_SHARED_BUCKET.md)
and per-region [`Regional_Shared_Bucket`](REGIONAL_SHARED_BUCKET.md), the model
weights bucket, the cost report bucket, the optional analytics Studio bucket, and
every server-access-log sink.

Each entry carries the deployment-contract facts, not just the name:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `id`, `role`, `scope` | Stable identifier; `primary` vs `access-logs`; `global` / `regional` / `monitoring` / `analytics` |
| `owning_stack`, `region` | Which stack creates it, and where |
| `bucket`, `arn`, `s3_uri` | Physical identity, resolved from SSM or CloudFormation — never reconstructed |
| `status`, `detail` | `deployed` or `not-deployed`, with the reason |
| `purpose`, `reserved_prefixes` | What it is for, and which object-key prefixes the platform already owns |
| `pod_access`, `discovery` | `read-write` / `read-only` / `none` for the job-pod role, and the ConfigMap key or SSM path a pod resolves it through |
| `removal_policy` | What teardown does to it |
| `sync_alias`, `opt_in` | The alias `storage sync` accepts, and the `cdk.json` toggle if it is optional |

`summary.pod_writable` is the short answer to "where can a job write?".

Buckets whose stack is not deployed are **included** with
`status: "not-deployed"` rather than omitted, so the inventory is complete even
before a region is rolled out.

```bash
gco storage s3-inventory [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Limit regional entries to one region; global, monitoring, and analytics entries are always included |

```bash
gco -o json storage s3-inventory
gco -o json storage s3-inventory --region us-east-1

# Where can a job write?
gco -o json storage s3-inventory | jq '.summary.pod_writable'

# Full records for the pod-writable buckets
gco -o json storage s3-inventory | jq '.buckets[] | select(.pod_access=="read-write")'

# What is not deployed yet, and why
gco -o json storage s3-inventory | jq '.buckets[] | select(.status=="not-deployed") | {id, detail}'
```

#### `gco storage sync`

Incrementally transfer files in one explicit direction: from a bucket or key
prefix to a local directory, or from a local file or directory to a bucket
prefix. Download remains the default for backward compatibility.

```bash
gco storage sync BUCKET_ALIAS LOCAL_PATH [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--direction` | | Transfer direction: `download` (default) or `upload` |
| `--region` | `-r` | Region for the unqualified `regional-shared` alias |
| `--prefix` | | Remote source prefix for download or destination prefix for upload |
| `--dry-run` | | Summarize the planned transfer without writing local files or S3 objects |
| `--force` | | Transfer every file even when the destination appears current |

```bash
# Download is the default; these two commands are equivalent
gco storage sync cluster-shared ./downloads/cluster
gco storage sync cluster-shared ./downloads/cluster --direction download

# Download one regional bucket (equivalent alias forms)
gco storage sync regional-shared:us-east-1 ./downloads/us-east-1
gco storage sync regional-shared ./downloads/us-east-1 --region us-east-1

# Download only one model prefix
gco storage sync model-weights ./downloads/llama3 --prefix models/llama3

# Upload a directory's contents beneath a remote prefix
gco storage sync cluster-shared ./results --direction upload --prefix runs/experiment-42

# Upload one file as checkpoints/latest.bin
gco storage sync model-weights ./latest.bin --direction upload --prefix checkpoints

# Inspect an upload plan without writing any S3 objects
gco storage sync analytics-studio ./studio-output --direction upload --dry-run
```

**Sync semantics and safety:**

- Each invocation uses exactly one direction. `download` is the default and is
  backward-compatible with earlier invocations; `upload` must be selected
  explicitly. There is intentionally no automatic `both` mode, conflict merge,
  or winner selection.
- Neither direction deletes destination-only data. Downloads never remove local
  files, uploads never remove remote objects, and `s3:DeleteObject` permission
  is not required.
- For downloads, `LOCAL_PATH` is a directory. Existing files are skipped when
  their size and modification time indicate they are current. Downloaded files
  receive the S3 `LastModified` time.
- For uploads, `LOCAL_PATH` must be an existing regular file or directory. A
  directory's contents are mapped recursively beneath `--prefix`; the source
  directory name itself is not added. A single file maps to
  `PREFIX/<file-name>`.
- Upload incrementality uses a SHA-256 digest stored as S3 user metadata named
  `gco-sync-sha256`. The same precomputed whole-file digest is sent as the
  base64 `ChecksumSHA256`, so S3 rejects an upload whose received bytes differ
  from the file that was planned. A remote object is skipped only when its size
  and digest metadata match the local file; skipped objects are checked again
  before a successful non-dry-run result. ETags are intentionally not used
  because multipart and SSE-KMS ETags are not reliable whole-file digests.
  Existing objects without this metadata are uploaded once to establish it.
- Upload planning rejects top-level or descendant symlinks, non-regular files,
  and unsafe relative names before the first PUT. It hashes every source file
  during planning and rejects a file if its identity, size, or timestamps
  change before or during upload. Planning issues `HeadObject` only for the
  generated destination keys; it does not list or materialize the remote
  prefix.
- `--prefix` behaves as a directory prefix in both directions: leading `/`
  characters are removed and a trailing `/` is added before remote operations.
- Every matching S3 key is validated before the first download. Absolute,
  traversal (`..`), empty-segment, NUL, backslash-based escape, non-empty
  trailing-slash, and local file/directory collision keys are rejected rather
  than written outside or ambiguously within the destination. On Windows,
  Win32 reserved names, forbidden or control characters, and names ending in a
  dot or space are also rejected, with conservative case-insensitive collision
  detection.
- `--force` bypasses the current-file check in the selected direction.
  `--dry-run` performs discovery and planning but writes neither local files nor
  S3 objects.
- A failed transfer can leave files or objects written earlier in that
  invocation. Rerun the same command to continue incrementally; the command
  never rolls back by deleting data.

**Required IAM permissions:**

- `ssm:GetParameter` on the project's model, cluster-shared, and regional-shared
  parameter paths used by the selected alias.
- `cloudformation:ListStackResources` on the analytics stack when listing or
  syncing `analytics-studio`.
- Downloads require `s3:ListBucket` on the selected bucket and `s3:GetObject`
  on its objects. SSE-KMS downloads also require `kms:Decrypt` on the key.
- Uploads probe only generated destination keys and require `s3:GetObject`
  (for `HeadObject` metadata checks), `s3:PutObject`, and
  `s3:AbortMultipartUpload`; they do not require `s3:ListBucket`. SSE-KMS
  uploads require `kms:GenerateDataKey` and commonly `kms:Decrypt`, especially
  for multipart upload.
- Neither direction requires `s3:DeleteObject`. The `analytics-studio` stack
  grants bucket access to its SageMaker role by default, so a human operator
  needs a separate IAM grant before syncing it directly.

### Images Commands

Manage container images in the project ECR registry. The CLI talks to
the global registry (the regional ECR replicas are populated by ECR
replication automatically). Project repositories live under the
`gco/` prefix; non-`gco/*` repositories cannot be touched through the
CLI.

See [Customization Guide](CUSTOMIZATION.md) for the full registry
architecture and lifecycle policy options.

```

#### `gco images build`

Build a container image and push it to the project's ECR repo. Uses
the local container runtime (Docker / [Finch](https://runfinch.com/) / [Podman](https://podman.io/docs)), authenticates
to ECR via `aws ecr get-login-password`, then pushes the resulting
image.

```bash

gco images delete-repo old-svc -y
gco images delete-repo orphaned-repo -y --force
```

#### `gco images cleanup`

Remove untagged images across one or all project repos. Useful after
a heavy push cycle has produced many orphaned manifest digests.

```bash
gco images cleanup --yes [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--name` | `-n` | Single repository to clean up |
| `--all` | | Clean up every project repo |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Required confirmation |

**Example:**

```bash
gco images cleanup --all -y
gco images cleanup -n my-app -y
```

#### `gco images prune`

Remove untagged images older than 30 days. Dry-run by default —
nothing is deleted unless you pass `--no-dry-run`.

```bash
gco images prune --yes [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--dry-run / --no-dry-run` | | Default: dry-run; pass `--no-dry-run` to delete |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Required confirmation |

**Example:**

```bash
gco images prune -y                    # dry-run only
gco images prune --no-dry-run -y       # actually delete
```

#### `gco images orphans`

List tags older than `threshold_days` that are not referenced by any
deployed inference endpoint or recent job. Cross-references against
both data sources before declaring a tag an orphan.

```bash
gco images orphans [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--threshold-days` | Only report tags older than this many days (default: 30) |

**Example:**

```bash
gco images orphans
gco images orphans --threshold-days 60
```

#### `gco images lifecycle`

Lifecycle policy management.

```bash
gco images lifecycle COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

**Subcommands:**

- `get NAME` - Print the lifecycle policy on a repository
- `set NAME --file <json>` - Replace the lifecycle policy from a JSON file

**Example:**

```bash
gco images lifecycle get my-app
gco images lifecycle set my-app --file lifecycle.json
```

#### `gco images mirror`

Mirror third-party images (e.g. the [Volcano](https://volcano.sh/) `docker.io` images) into the project ECR. This is the same multi-arch copy `gco stacks deploy` runs automatically when `volcano_image_mirror.enabled` is set; run it directly to pre-seed a region before enabling the toggle, or to re-mirror after bumping a mirrored image version. Wraps the shared `cli._image_mirror` core (also used by the `images_mirror` MCP tool).

```bash
gco images mirror [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Target AWS region; must match the regional stack (required) |
| `--ecr-namespace` | | Destination ECR namespace (default: cdk.json `volcano_image_mirror.ecr_namespace`) |
| `--no-skip-existing` | | Re-copy images even if the tag already exists in ECR |
| `--dry-run` | | Print the copy plan without creating repos or copying images |

**Example:**

```bash
gco images mirror --region us-east-1
gco images mirror --region us-east-1 --dry-run
gco images mirror --region us-east-1 --ecr-namespace gco/dockerhub
```

#### `gco images replication`

Replication management for the project's ECR registry.

```bash
gco images replication COMMAND
```

**Subcommands:**

- `get` - Print the current ECR replication configuration
- `status` - Print per-image replication status across project repos
- `sync` - Apply the project's standard replication rule (`gco/*` to all deployed regions)

**Example:**

```bash
gco images replication get
gco images replication status
gco images replication sync
```

### Nodepools Commands

Manage [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/) NodePools.

<details>
<summary>All <code>gco nodepools</code> commands (5) — click to expand</summary>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`gco nodepools list`](#gco-nodepools-list) | List NodePools in a cluster. |
| [`gco nodepools describe`](#gco-nodepools-describe) | Describe a specific NodePool. |
| [`gco nodepools create-odcr`](#gco-nodepools-create-odcr) | Generate nodepool manifest for ODCR (On-Demand Capacity Reservation). |
| [`gco nodepools create-capacity-block`](#gco-nodepools-create-capacity-block) | Generate nodepool manifest for a purchased Capacity Block. |
| [`gco nodepools delete`](#gco-nodepools-delete) | Delete a NodePool and its paired EC2NodeClass. |

</details>

#### `gco nodepools list`

List NodePools in a cluster.

```bash
gco nodepools list [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Region |

#### `gco nodepools describe`

Describe a specific NodePool.

```bash
gco nodepools describe NODEPOOL_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--region` | `-r` | Region |

#### `gco nodepools create-odcr`

Generate nodepool manifest for ODCR (On-Demand Capacity Reservation).

```bash
gco nodepools create-odcr [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--name` | `-n` | NodePool name (required) |
| `--region` | `-r` | AWS region (required) |
| `--capacity-reservation-id` | `-c` | EC2 Capacity Reservation ID (`cr-xxx`) or ODCR group ARN (required) |
| `--instance-type` | `-i` | Instance type (repeatable) |
| `--output-file` | `-o` | Output manifest to file instead of applying |

**Example:**

```bash
gco nodepools create-odcr \

```

#### `gco nodepools create-capacity-block`

Generate a Karpenter NodePool manifest for a purchased Capacity Block — the Capacity Block counterpart to [`gco nodepools create-odcr`](#gco-nodepools-create-odcr). Purchasing a Capacity Block (`gco capacity reserve`) yields an EC2 Capacity Reservation ID (`cr-xxx`), which the generated NodePool consumes via `capacityReservationSelectorTerms`. Because a block is prepaid for a fixed term, the NodePool defaults to holding the capacity (`WhenEmpty` consolidation) rather than consolidating it away early.

```bash
gco nodepools create-capacity-block [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--name` | `-n` | NodePool name (required) |

  --region us-east-1 \
  --capacity-reservation-id cr-0123456789abcdef0 \
  --instance-type p5.48xlarge \
  --output-file nodepool.yaml
```

#### `gco nodepools delete`

### Monitoring Commands

Manage in-cluster observability (`kube-prometheus-stack`: [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) + Grafana +
Alertmanager). Unlike most features this one is **on by default** on every
regional cluster. See the [Monitoring Guide](MONITORING.md) for the cost model,
private-endpoint access, and credential rotation.

Grafana has no public endpoint, so `gco monitoring open` port-forwards over the
PRIVATE EKS API endpoint and can tunnel through an SSM-managed instance with
`--via-ssm`. The `users` subcommands drive Grafana's admin HTTP API over that
port-forward.

<details>
<summary>All <code>gco monitoring</code> commands (7) — click to expand</summary>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`gco monitoring status`](#gco-monitoring-status) | Show the current `cluster_observability.*` toggle state from `cdk.json`. |
| [`gco monitoring enable`](#gco-monitoring-enable) | Flip `cluster_observability.enabled` to `true` in `cdk.json`. |
| [`gco monitoring disable`](#gco-monitoring-disable) | Flip `cluster_observability.enabled` to `false` in `cdk.json`. |
| [`gco monitoring open`](#gco-monitoring-open) | Port-forward Grafana / Prometheus / Alertmanager / OpenCost / MLflow over the private endpoint (optionally via an SSM tunnel). |
| [`gco monitoring users add`](#gco-monitoring-users) | Create a Grafana user via the admin API. |
| [`gco monitoring users list`](#gco-monitoring-users) | List Grafana organisation users. |
| [`gco monitoring users remove`](#gco-monitoring-users) | Delete a Grafana user. |

</details>

#### `gco monitoring status`

Show the merged `cluster_observability` config (toggle plus grafana / prometheus
/ alertmanager sub-blocks) from `cdk.json`.

```bash
gco monitoring status
```

#### `gco monitoring enable`

Flip `cluster_observability.enabled` to `true` in `cdk.json` (it is already on by
default). Takes effect on the next `gco stacks deploy`.

```bash
gco monitoring enable [-y]
```

#### `gco monitoring disable`

Flip `cluster_observability.enabled` to `false`. The grafana / prometheus /
alertmanager sub-blocks are left untouched so preferences survive a
disable/enable cycle. The in-cluster stack and its EBS volumes are removed on the
next deploy.

```bash
gco monitoring disable [-y]
```

#### `gco monitoring open`

Port-forward a monitoring component over the private EKS API endpoint. Runs in
the foreground; press Ctrl-C to stop.

```bash
gco monitoring open [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--service` | `grafana` (default, `localhost:3000`), `prometheus` (`:9090`), `alertmanager` (`:9093`), `opencost` (the OpenCost UI, `:9091`), `opencost-api` (the OpenCost allocation API, `:9003`), or `mlflow` (the MLflow tracking UI, `:5000`). The OpenCost targets exist when `cost_monitoring.enabled` is on — see [docs/COST_MONITORING.md](COST_MONITORING.md); the MLflow target when `cluster_observability.mlflow.enabled` is on — see [docs/MONITORING.md](MONITORING.md#mlflow-experiment-tracking). |
| `--region` | Cluster region (defaults to the first `deployment_regions.regional` entry). |
| `--local-port` | Override the local bind port. |
| `--via-ssm INSTANCE_ID` | Tunnel to the private API endpoint through an SSM-managed instance (requires the Session Manager plugin). |

**Example:**

```bash
# From inside the VPC:
gco monitoring open --region us-east-1

# From a laptop, tunnelling through an SSM-managed instance:
gco monitoring open --region us-east-1 --via-ssm i-0123456789abcdef0
```

#### `gco monitoring users`

Manage Grafana users through the admin HTTP API, over an active
`gco monitoring open` port-forward (default `http://localhost:3000`). Admin
credentials are read from the `kube-prometheus-stack-grafana` Secret, or passed
with `--admin-password` / `$GCO_GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

```bash
gco monitoring users add --username alice --email alice@example.com --generate-password
gco monitoring users list [--as-json]
gco monitoring users remove --username alice --yes
```

---

### Cluster Commands

Reach a cluster's **PRIVATE** EKS API endpoint from outside the VPC over an AWS
Systems Manager tunnel, so `kubectl` works without a VPN or a standing bastion.
`gco cluster tunnel` is the general form of the SSM tunnelling that
`gco monitoring open` uses for Grafana; the MCP `cluster_tunnel_command` tool
(see [`gco_mcp/tools/README.md`](../gco_mcp/tools/README.md)) returns the same
connection plan for agents.

<details>
<summary>All <code>gco cluster</code> commands (2) — click to expand</summary>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`gco cluster tunnel`](#gco-cluster-tunnel) | Open (or `--print`) an SSM tunnel to the private EKS API endpoint, optionally auto-provisioning a self-terminating ephemeral bastion. |
| [`gco cluster doctor`](#gco-cluster-doctor) | Diagnose EKS API access layer by layer: reachability, authentication, authorization, and the kubeconfig context. |

</details>

#### `gco cluster tunnel`

Open an SSM Session Manager tunnel to the cluster's private API endpoint and hold
it open in the foreground (Ctrl-C to stop), printing the `kubectl` flags to use
in another shell. With `--print` it instead emits the ready-to-run tunnel +
`kubectl` commands (a connection plan) without opening anything — JSON under
`gco --output json`, copy-paste shell commands otherwise.

```bash
gco cluster tunnel [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--region` | Cluster region (defaults to the first `deployment_regions.regional` entry). |
| `--via-ssm INSTANCE_ID\|auto` | Tunnel through an existing SSM-managed instance, or `auto` to provision a self-terminating ephemeral bastion and tear it down on exit. |
| `--local-port` | Local port to bind for the API tunnel (default `8443`). |
| `--print` | Print the tunnel + `kubectl` connection plan instead of opening the tunnel. |
| `--bastion-ttl-minutes` | Self-terminate backstop for an `--via-ssm auto` bastion (default `120`). |
| `--yes` / `-y` | Skip the confirmation prompt when provisioning an `--via-ssm auto` bastion. |

The `auto` bastion is a minimal `t3.micro` (falling back through `t3a.micro`,
`t3.small`, then `t2.micro` when a Region or AZ can't launch the preferred
type) in the cluster VPC that reuses the
cluster security group (no new security group, and **no inbound ports** — SSM is
outbound-only), requires IMDSv2, self-terminates after `--bastion-ttl-minutes`,
and is tagged `gco:ephemeral=true`. It is torn down automatically when the tunnel
closes; if teardown ever fails, the command prints the exact orphan-check
command.

**Example:**

```bash
# Auto-provision an ephemeral bastion, tunnel, and hold it open:
gco cluster tunnel --region us-east-1 --via-ssm auto

# In another shell, run kubectl through the tunnel:
kubectl --server https://127.0.0.1:8443 \
    --tls-server-name <endpoint-host> get nodes

# Or just print the connection plan (no changes made, JSON for scripting):
gco cluster tunnel --region us-east-1 --print
gco --output json cluster tunnel --region us-east-1 --via-ssm i-0123456789abcdef0 --print
```

Opening a tunnel does **not** replace an EKS access entry: the tunnel solves
reachability, while authentication still needs `gco stacks access -r <region>`
(or a `developer_access` entry in cdk.json). Run `gco cluster doctor` when
unsure which layer is failing.

#### `gco cluster doctor`

Diagnose EKS API access from this machine, one layer at a time. The layers
fail with misleading and overlapping symptoms:

- kubectl **timeouts** → reachability (a `PRIVATE` endpoint, or a public CIDR
  allowlist your egress IP is outside of);
- kubectl **`Unauthorized`** → authentication (no EKS access entry for your
  principal — by default only platform Lambdas have one);
- RBAC **`Forbidden`** → authorization (an entry with no associated access
  policy);
- kubectl **`no such host`** → a stale kubeconfig context pointing at a
  **destroyed** cluster, which looks exactly like a private-endpoint problem
  and misleads the diagnosis in the other direction.

Each check reports `ok`/`warn`/`fail`/`unknown` with the remedy for what it
actually found (`gco cluster tunnel`, `gco stacks access`,
`aws eks update-kubeconfig`, or a redeploy). Exits nonzero if any layer fails.

```bash
gco cluster doctor [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--region` | Cluster region (defaults to the first `deployment_regions.regional` entry). |

**Example:**

```bash
gco cluster doctor --region us-east-1
gco --output json cluster doctor    # structured checks for scripting
```

---

### Analytics Commands

Manage the optional GCO analytics environment (SageMaker Studio + EMR
Serverless + Cognito). The feature is **off by default**; enable it only
when you want interactive notebook analytics. See the
[Analytics Guide](ANALYTICS.md) for end-to-end workflows.

All `gco analytics *` commands auto-discover the Cognito user-pool ID
and API Gateway endpoint from the `gco-analytics` and `gco-api-gateway`
CloudFormation outputs, so no manual ID wiring is needed.

<details>
<summary>All <code>gco analytics</code> commands (9) — click to expand</summary>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`gco analytics enable`](#gco-analytics-enable) | Flip `analytics_environment.enabled` to `true` in `cdk.json`. |
| [`gco analytics disable`](#gco-analytics-disable) | Flip `analytics_environment.enabled` to `false` in `cdk.json`. |
| [`gco analytics status`](#gco-analytics-status) | Show the current `analytics_environment.*` toggle state from `cdk.json` plus the deployment state of `gco-analytics`. |
| [`gco analytics users add`](#gco-analytics-users-add) | Create a Cognito user in the analytics user pool. |
| [`gco analytics users list`](#gco-analytics-users-list) | List Cognito users in the analytics user pool. |
| [`gco analytics users remove`](#gco-analytics-users-remove) | Delete a Cognito user from the analytics user pool. |
| [`gco analytics users set-password`](#gco-analytics-users-set-password) | Change a Cognito user's password via ``AdminSetUserPassword``. |
| [`gco analytics studio login`](#gco-analytics-studio-login) | Sign in to SageMaker Studio via Cognito SRP and print a presigned Studio URL on its own line on stdout (pipe-friendly). |
| [`gco analytics doctor`](#gco-analytics-doctor) | Run pre-flight checks before `gco stacks deploy gco-analytics`. |

</details>

#### `gco analytics enable`

Flip `analytics_environment.enabled` to `true` in `cdk.json`. Prints
the follow-up `gco stacks deploy gco-analytics` command — does not
deploy automatically.

```bash
gco analytics enable [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--hyperpod` | | Also set `analytics_environment.hyperpod.enabled=true` (adds HyperPod training-job permissions to the SageMaker execution role). |
| `--canvas` | | Also set `analytics_environment.canvas.enabled=true` (attaches `AmazonSageMakerCanvasFullAccess` to the SageMaker execution role and enables the Canvas app on the Studio domain; artifacts land under `Cluster_Shared_Bucket/analytics-canvas/`). |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip the confirmation prompt. |

**Example:**

```bash
gco analytics enable
gco analytics enable --hyperpod
gco analytics enable --canvas
gco analytics enable --hyperpod --canvas -y

# Follow-up to actually deploy the stack:
gco stacks deploy gco-analytics
```

#### `gco analytics disable`

Flip `analytics_environment.enabled` to `false` in `cdk.json`. Leaves
the `hyperpod`, `canvas`, `cognito`, and `efs` sub-blocks untouched so
a later `enable` preserves your preferences. Run `gco stacks destroy
gco-analytics` afterward to tear down the deployed resources.

```bash
gco analytics disable [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip the confirmation prompt. |

**Example:**

```bash
gco analytics disable
gco analytics disable -y
gco stacks destroy gco-analytics
```

#### `gco analytics status`

Show the current `analytics_environment.*` toggle state from `cdk.json`
plus the deployment state of `gco-analytics`.

```bash
gco analytics status
```

**Example:**

```bash
gco analytics status
```

#### `gco analytics users add`

Create a Cognito user in the analytics user pool. Calls
`cognito-idp:AdminCreateUser` and prints the temporary password to
stdout exactly once. Optionally sets a permanent password via
`cognito-idp:AdminSetUserPassword` so the user can sign in without the
`NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` challenge on first login.

```bash
gco analytics users add [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--username` | Cognito username to create (required). |
| `--email` | Email address for the new user. |
| `--no-email` | Suppress the Cognito welcome email (`MessageAction=SUPPRESS`). |
| `--password` | Set a permanent password on the new user (also read from `$GCO_STUDIO_PASSWORD`). Mutually exclusive with `--generate-password`. |
| `--generate-password` | Generate a strong random password, set it permanent, and print it once. Mutually exclusive with `--password`. |

**Example:**

```bash
gco analytics users add --username alice --email alice@example.com
gco analytics users add --username bob --email bob@example.com --no-email

# Set a permanent password so first-time login doesn't hit NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED
gco analytics users add --username carol --no-email --generate-password
GCO_STUDIO_PASSWORD='StrongP@ssw0rd!' gco analytics users add --username dave --no-email --password "$GCO_STUDIO_PASSWORD"
```

#### `gco analytics users list`

List Cognito users in the analytics user pool. Default output is a
formatted table via the existing `OutputFormatter`.

```bash
gco analytics users list [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--as-json` | Emit JSON instead of a table. |

**Example:**

```bash
gco analytics users list
gco analytics users list --as-json
```

#### `gco analytics users remove`

Delete a Cognito user from the analytics user pool. Does not delete
the user's Studio user profile or EFS home folder — use
`aws sagemaker delete-user-profile` for that.

```bash
gco analytics users remove [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--username` | Cognito username to remove (required). |
| `--yes` | Skip the confirmation prompt. |

**Example:**

```bash
gco analytics users remove --username alice
gco analytics users remove --username alice --yes
```

#### `gco analytics users set-password`

Change a Cognito user's password via ``AdminSetUserPassword``. By
default the new password is marked permanent so the user can sign in
directly with ``gco analytics studio login`` without hitting the
``NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED`` challenge. Pass ``--temporary`` to require
the user to choose their own password on first sign-in.

```bash
gco analytics users set-password [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--username` | Cognito username whose password to change (required). |
| `--password` | New password (also read from `$GCO_STUDIO_PASSWORD`; prompted otherwise). Mutually exclusive with `--generate-password`. |
| `--generate-password` | Generate a strong random password, set it, and print it once. Mutually exclusive with `--password`. |
| `--temporary` | Set the password as temporary (`Permanent=false`). Default is permanent. |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip the confirmation prompt. |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive — prompts twice for the new password
gco analytics users set-password --username alice

# Non-interactive via env var (won't leak into shell history)
GCO_STUDIO_PASSWORD='StrongP@ssw0rd!' \
  gco analytics users set-password --username alice --yes

# Generate and print a new password
gco analytics users set-password --username alice --generate-password --yes

# Force the user to reset on next login
gco analytics users set-password --username alice \
  --password 'Temp!Reset123$' --temporary --yes
```

#### `gco analytics studio login`

Sign in to SageMaker Studio via Cognito SRP and print a presigned
Studio URL on its own line on stdout (pipe-friendly). The password,
`IdToken`, and URL are never written to disk.

```bash
gco analytics studio login [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--username` | Cognito username (required). |
| `--password` | Password. Defaults to prompt (`click.prompt(..., hide_input=True)`). Also read from `$GCO_STUDIO_PASSWORD` if set. |
| `--api-url` | Override the API Gateway base URL (otherwise auto-discovered from CloudFormation). |
| `--open` | Launch the default browser on the presigned URL after printing it. |

**Example:**

```bash
# Interactive (prompts for password)
gco analytics studio login --username alice

# Non-interactive
export GCO_STUDIO_PASSWORD='...'
gco analytics studio login --username alice

# Open browser automatically
gco analytics studio login --username alice --open

# Custom API endpoint
gco analytics studio login \
  --username alice \
  --api-url https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
```

#### `gco analytics doctor`

Run pre-flight checks before `gco stacks deploy gco-analytics`. Each
check prints `✓`/`✗` plus a short remediation line. Exits `1` on any
failing check.

Checks performed:

- `cdk.json` is present and parses as JSON
- `gco-global`, `gco-api-gateway`, and every regional stack are
  `CREATE_COMPLETE`
- The three `/gco/cluster-shared-bucket/*` SSM parameters are
  present in the global region
- No orphaned retained analytics resources are left from a previous
  `retain`-policy destroy

```bash
gco analytics doctor
```

**Example:**

```bash
gco analytics doctor
```

### Config-Cmd Commands

Manage the local CLI configuration file at `~/.gco/config.yaml`. The
config file lets you set per-machine defaults (default region, output
format, verbose flag) so you don't have to repeat them on every
invocation.

<details>
<summary>All <code>gco config-cmd</code> commands (3) — click to expand</summary>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`gco config-cmd init`](#gco-config-cmd-init) | Initialize the config file with a starter template. |
| [`gco config-cmd show`](#gco-config-cmd-show) | Print the current resolved configuration (file values plus any environment-variable overrides). |
| [`gco config-cmd get`](#gco-config-cmd-get) | Read one configuration value by key (or the full config). |

</details>

#### `gco config-cmd init`

Initialize the config file with a starter template.

```bash
gco config-cmd init [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--force` | `-f` | Overwrite an existing config file |

**Example:**

```bash
gco config-cmd init
gco config-cmd init -f          # overwrite existing
```

#### `gco config-cmd show`

Print the current resolved configuration (file values plus any
environment-variable overrides).

```bash
gco config-cmd show
```

#### `gco config-cmd get`

Read one configuration value by key (dotted paths supported), or print the full config when no key is given.

```bash
gco config-cmd get [KEY]
```

**Example:**

```bash
gco config-cmd get
gco config-cmd get default_region
```

### Tasks Commands

Inspect long-running MCP tool invocations through their disk-backed
status surface. Every long-running tool (`deploy_all`, `destroy_all`,
`bootstrap_cdk`, `deploy_stack`, `destroy_stack`, `images_build`,
`images_push`) writes a JSON status file plus a raw output log under
`~/.gco/tasks/{task_id}.{json,log}` on every line, so an operator
with a terminal can see real-time progress even when the MCP client
drops or buries notifications.

The directory is configurable via `GCO_TASK_STATUS_DIR`. Set
`GCO_DISABLE_TASK_STATUS=1` to skip disk emission for sandboxed
environments where `~/.gco` isn't writable.

<details>
<summary>All <code>gco tasks</code> commands (4) — click to expand</summary>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`gco tasks list`](#gco-tasks-list) | List recent tasks, newest first. |
| [`gco tasks show TASK_ID`](#gco-tasks-show-task_id) | Print the full JSON status record for a single task. |
| [`gco tasks tail TASK_ID`](#gco-tasks-tail-task_id) | Print the last N lines of a task's raw output log. |
| [`gco tasks prune`](#gco-tasks-prune) | Remove all but the most-recent N task files. |

</details>

#### `gco tasks list`

List recent tasks, newest first. Reports the state, elapsed time,
stack count, last stack name, and task ID for each. Tasks whose
recorded PID is no longer alive but whose state still says `running`
are reported as `orphaned` so callers see honest data even when the
original MCP wrapper exited unexpectedly.

```bash
gco tasks list [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `-n, --limit INTEGER` — Maximum tasks to show (default: 20)
- `--json` — Emit raw JSON instead of a table

```bash
gco tasks list
gco tasks list -n 5
gco tasks list --json | jq '.tasks[] | select(.state == "orphaned")'
```

#### `gco tasks show TASK_ID`

Print the full JSON status record for a single task. Includes the
original argv, the last 20 output lines, the recorded PID, and the
path to the full log file. Useful when `gco tasks list` shows a
state worth digging into (failed/orphaned/cancelled).

```bash
gco tasks show deploy_all-1747683123-42
```

#### `gco tasks tail TASK_ID`

Print the last N lines of a task's raw output log. Each line is
prefixed with `[stdout]` or `[stderr]` so streams stay distinguishable
in the interleaved order the subprocess produced them. The `--follow`
mode polls the log file like `tail -f`.

```bash
gco tasks tail TASK_ID [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `-n, --lines INTEGER` — Lines to show from the end of the log (default: 100)
- `-f, --follow` — Stream new lines as they're written
- `--interval FLOAT` — Polling interval in seconds when `--follow` is set (default: 1.0)

```bash
gco tasks tail deploy_all-1747683123-42
gco tasks tail deploy_all-1747683123-42 -n 500
gco tasks tail deploy_all-1747683123-42 -f
```

#### `gco tasks prune`

Remove all but the most-recent N task files. Pruning happens
automatically when new tasks start, but a manual sweep is sometimes
useful (e.g. after a flurry of failed retries cluttered the directory).

```bash
gco tasks prune [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `--keep INTEGER` — Number of most-recent tasks to keep (default: 50)

```bash
gco tasks prune --keep 10
```

### Mission Commands

Drive a goal-directed iteration loop with machine-checkable success
criteria and an optional advisory LLM. Mission is gated by the
`GCO_ENABLE_MISSION=true` environment variable (or the umbrella
`GCO_ENABLE_ALL_TOOLS=true`); without the flag every subcommand exits
2 with a one-line hint.

The full design lives in [Mission Guide](MISSION.md). This section
covers the CLI surface only.

Sessions persist as JSON under `~/.gco/missions/` (the filesystem
backend) or in the `<project>-missions` DynamoDB table when
`GCO_MISSION_STATE_BACKEND=dynamodb`. The sampling backend resolves
in this order:

1. Explicit `--use-sampling` / `--no-sampling` flag.
2. MCP host capability (only when running inside an MCP host).
3. Bedrock credential probe — when `boto3` resolves credentials, the
   Bedrock backend is selected with the model id from
   `GCO_MISSION_BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` (or `cdk.json`
   `context.bedrock.mission_default_model_id`).
4. Otherwise sampling is off and the loop runs deterministically.

<details>

</details>

#### `gco mission run`

Chained shorthand that scaffolds criteria from a directive, persists
a new session, and drives it through iterations until a terminal
verdict — three steps in one call. The most common operator workflow
when you don't need a saved criteria file or per-step inspection.

```bash
gco mission run [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `--directive TEXT` — Required. Natural-language goal description.
- `--tool-allowlist NAME` — Required, repeatable. Tools the loop may invoke. The first allowlisted tool also seeds the deterministic strategy when sampling is off.
- `--max-iterations INTEGER` — Iteration cap (default: 5). Pass `-1` to opt out.
- `--max-wall-clock INTEGER` — Wall-clock cap in seconds (default: 300). Pass `-1` to opt out.
- `--max-criteria INTEGER` — Cap on the number of criterion entries the scaffolder emits (default: 5).
- `--retries INTEGER` — Sampling-path retry budget on validator rejection (default: 3). After exhaustion, falls back to deterministic templates.
- `--use-sampling` / `--no-sampling` — Force the sampling path on/off for both the scaffolder and the loop's Strategy_Revision sampler. Default auto-detects.
- `--bedrock-model-id MODEL_ID` — Override the Bedrock model id (CLI sampling backend only).
- `--allow-scripted-strategies` — Permit scripted strategies (the AST-validated Python sandbox).
- `--save-criteria PATH` — Also write the scaffolded criteria JSON to `PATH` for inspection or reuse.
- `--cadence` — Checkpoint cadence kind (default: `every_iteration`).
- `--stagnation-threshold INTEGER` — Iterations of no progress before terminate (default: 3).

A scaffold-summary JSON line lands on stderr before iteration starts; per-iteration verdicts stream to stderr as JSON lines; the Final_Report lands on stdout when a terminal verdict fires.

```bash
# No-AWS smoke test against in-memory tools.
export GCO_ENABLE_MISSION=true
gco mission run \
  --directive "Find documentation about inference endpoints." \
  --tool-allowlist find_examples --tool-allowlist find_docs \
  --max-iterations 1 --max-wall-clock 30 \
  --no-sampling

# Bedrock-backed run with a captured criteria file.
gco mission run \
  --directive "Drive validation loss below 0.1." \
  --tool-allowlist find_examples \
  --max-iterations 10 --max-wall-clock 1800 \
  --save-criteria /tmp/criteria.json
```

#### `gco mission start`

Validate inputs, resolve sampling, persist a new session. Use this
when you want to inspect or modify the criteria file by hand, or when
you want to drive iterations one at a time.

```bash
gco mission start [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `--directive TEXT` — Required. Natural-language goal description.
- `--criteria-file PATH` — Required (unless `--with-defaults` is set). JSON file containing the criteria list.
- `--with-defaults` — Use a basic placeholder predicate criterion when no `--criteria-file` is provided.
- `--max-iterations INTEGER` — Required. Hard cap on iterations. Pass `-1` to opt out (uncapped).
- `--max-wall-clock INTEGER` — Required. Hard cap on wall-clock seconds. Pass `-1` to opt out (uncapped).
- `--tool-allowlist NAME` — Required, repeatable. Tools the loop may invoke.
- `--cadence` — Checkpoint cadence kind (default: `every_iteration`).
- `--cadence-n INTEGER` — `n` parameter for `every_n_iterations`.
- `--cadence-t INTEGER` — `t` parameter (seconds) for `every_t_seconds`.
- `--cadence-event TEXT` — `event_name` parameter for `on_event`.
- `--stagnation-threshold INTEGER` — Iterations of no progress before terminate (default: 3).
- `--use-sampling` / `--no-sampling` — Force sampling on/off (default: auto-detect).
- `--bedrock-model-id MODEL_ID` — Override the Bedrock model id.
- `--allow-scripted-strategies` — Permit scripted strategies.
- `--run` — Iterate to completion synchronously after creating the session.
- `--output table|json` — Output format (default: `json`).

```bash
gco mission start \
  --directive "Drive validation loss below 0.1." \
  --criteria-file /tmp/criteria.json \
  --max-iterations 10 --max-wall-clock 3600 \
  --tool-allowlist find_examples
```

#### `gco mission scaffold-criteria`

Draft a criteria file from a natural-language directive. Output is
always validated through `validate_criteria` so the resulting file
is immediately usable with `gco mission start --criteria-file` or
`gco mission run --save-criteria` for inspection.

```bash
gco mission scaffold-criteria [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `--directive TEXT` — Required. Natural-language goal description.
- `--allowlist NAME` — Optional, repeatable. Tools that will be allowlisted on the resulting session. When the directive is search-flavoured *and* an allowlist is supplied, the deterministic generator emits one `tool_call_succeeded` criterion per allowlisted tool — server-evaluated, never goes through the predicate AST sandbox.
- `--use-sampling` / `--no-sampling` — Force sampling on/off (default: auto-detect).
- `--bedrock-model-id MODEL_ID` — Override the Bedrock model id.
- `--max-criteria INTEGER` — Cap on the number of criterion entries (default: 5).
- `--retries INTEGER` — Sampling-path retry budget (default: 3).
- `--output-file PATH` — Write the JSON to this file instead of stdout.
- `--output table|json` — Output format (default: `json`).

```bash
gco mission scaffold-criteria \
  --directive "Find documentation about inference endpoints." \
  --allowlist find_examples --allowlist find_docs \
  --output-file criteria.json
```

#### `gco mission iterate SESSION_ID`

Drive one or more iterations of an existing session. Stops early on a
terminal verdict. The CLI uses a stub tool dispatcher; real tool
execution requires the MCP server.

```bash
gco mission iterate SESSION_ID [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `--max-iterations INTEGER` — How many iterations to run in this call (default: 1). Distinct from the session-wide budget cap.
- `--output table|json` — Output format (default: `json`).

```bash
gco mission iterate mission-abc123 --max-iterations 3
```

#### `gco mission status SESSION_ID`

Print the full state of a session.

```bash
gco mission status SESSION_ID [--output table|json]
```

```bash
gco mission status mission-abc123 --output table
```

#### `gco mission checkpoint SESSION_ID`

Re-run the verdict cascade on the latest iteration without producing
a new one. Useful for inspecting how a paused or stalled session
would terminate if the cascade fired now.

```bash
gco mission checkpoint SESSION_ID [--output table|json]
```

#### `gco mission complete SESSION_ID`

Force a session into `completed` and stamp the final verdict.

```bash
gco mission complete SESSION_ID [--output table|json]
```

#### `gco mission abort SESSION_ID`

Pause or terminate a session. With `--pause` the session can be
resumed later; without `--pause` the session is terminated and the
final verdict is stamped.

```bash
gco mission abort SESSION_ID [--pause] [--output table|json]
```

```bash
gco mission abort mission-abc123 --pause
```

#### `gco mission resume SESSION_ID`

Transition a paused session back to `running`.

```bash
gco mission resume SESSION_ID [--output table|json]
```

#### `gco mission history SESSION_ID`

Get the iteration history of a session.

```bash
gco mission history SESSION_ID [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `--format full|summary` — Iteration history detail level (default: `summary`).
- `--output table|json` — Output format (default: `json`).

```bash
gco mission history mission-abc123 --format full
```

#### `gco mission list`

List Mission sessions across the configured backend.

```bash
gco mission list [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

- `--status STATUS` — Filter sessions by status (`pending`, `running`, `paused`, ...).
- `--output table|json` — Output format (default: `json`).

```bash
gco mission list --status running --output table
```

#### `gco mission memory search DIRECTIVE`

Search [mission memory](MISSION.md#mission-memory) for the completed missions most similar to
`DIRECTIVE`. The directive is embedded with the configured Bedrock embedding
model and matched against the `{project}-mission-memory` DynamoDB vector
index — the same institutional memory the engine consults on sampling
sessions. Results carry each mission's directive, lessons, recommended
follow-ups, verdict, and a similarity score.

```bash
gco mission memory search "reduce validation loss on the demo model" --top-k 5
```

**Options:**

- `--top-k N` — Number of similar past missions to return (default: `3`).
- `--verdict complete|terminate` — Only return missions that ended with this terminal verdict.
- `--output table|json` — Output format (default: `json`).

Requires the mission-memory add-on (`mission_memory.enabled` in `cdk.json`,
on by default) deployed with the global stack. When the table or index is
absent — or the vector index is still backfilling after first deployment —
the command prints a deployment hint and exits `1`.

#### `gco mission memory list`

List what mission memory currently holds, newest completion first. Summaries
only (session id, directive, verdict, iteration count, timestamps, embedding
model) — use [`gco mission memory search DIRECTIVE`](#gco-mission-memory-search-directive) to retrieve lessons.

```bash
gco mission memory list --limit 20 --output table
```

**Options:**

- `--limit N` — Maximum memory items to return (default: `50`).
- `--output table|json` — Output format (default: `json`).

#### `gco mission memory backfill`

Seed mission memory from existing Final_Reports: reads every
`*.report.json` under the report root, embeds each terminal report's
directive, and writes one memory item per report — so recall is useful on
day one instead of accumulating from zero. Re-running is safe: writes are
keyed on `session_id` and simply overwrite. Non-terminal or malformed files
are counted as `skipped`; per-report write failures are isolated, listed in
the output, and turn the exit code to `1`.

```bash
gco mission memory backfill
```

**Options:**

- `--root DIR` — Directory holding `*.report.json` Final_Reports (default: the filesystem mission root, `~/.gco/missions`).

---

### Swarm Commands

Swarm supervision: one **orchestrator** Mission session spawns and drives
concurrent **child** Mission sessions through in-process supervisor tools,
under hard rails (fleet cap, pooled child-iteration budget, concurrency
bound, mandatory-finite child budgets), until the orchestrator's
deterministic verdict cascade reaches a terminal verdict. See
[SWARM.md](SWARM.md) for the supervisor model and the determinism boundary.

The whole group is gated: set `GCO_ENABLE_SWARM=true` (or
`GCO_ENABLE_ALL_TOOLS=true`) or every subcommand exits with code 2 and a
hint. Enabling `GCO_ENABLE_MISSION` alongside is recommended so child
sessions are inspectable with `gco mission status`.

<details>
<summary>All <code>gco swarm</code> commands (7) — click to expand</summary>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`gco swarm run`](#gco-swarm-run) | Scaffold a plan from a directive, start a swarm, prime the fleet, and drive it to completion in one call. |
| [`gco swarm start`](#gco-swarm-start) | Validate inputs and persist a new orchestrator session without driving it. |
| [`gco swarm iterate SESSION_ID`](#gco-swarm-iterate-session_id) | Drive (or resume) an existing swarm's fleet. |
| [`gco swarm status SESSION_ID`](#gco-swarm-status-session_id) | One-call fleet rollup: rails, pool balance, child table, findings. |
| [`gco swarm abort SESSION_ID`](#gco-swarm-abort-session_id) | Terminate the orchestrator and abort every non-terminal child. |
| [`gco swarm list`](#gco-swarm-list) | List swarm (orchestrator) sessions. |
| [`gco swarm scaffold-plan`](#gco-swarm-scaffold-plan) | Draft a validated Swarm_Plan for review, without starting anything. |

</details>

#### `gco swarm run`

Scaffold a plan from the directive (sampled when a backend resolves, with a
deterministic single-worker fallback), persist an orchestrator whose default
criteria require every planned child to complete with zero failures, prime
the fleet through the spawn seam, and drive it to a terminal verdict. Spawn
envelopes and per-iteration verdicts stream to stderr as JSON lines; the
orchestrator's Final_Report lands on stdout. Exit code 0 on `complete`, 3 on
any other terminal verdict.

```bash
export GCO_ENABLE_SWARM=true

gco swarm run \
  --directive "Search the docs and examples catalogs and surface hits." \
  --tool-allowlist find_docs \
  --max-children 3 --child-iteration-pool 15 \
  --no-sampling --dry-run
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--directive` | The swarm-level goal, natural language (required). |
| `--tool-allowlist NAME` | Tool allowed to scaffolded children (repeatable). |
| `--allow-all-tools` | Resolve child allowlists to every registered tool (minus loop-management names). |
| `--max-children` | Fleet cap on live child slots (default 3). |
| `--child-iteration-pool` | Pooled child-iteration budget every spawn reserves from (default 15). |
| `--max-concurrent-children` | Concurrency bound on simultaneously advancing children (default 3). |
| `--allow-overlapping-mutating-tools` | Allow two live children to share a non-read-only tool (off by default). |
| `--max-iterations` / `--max-wall-clock` | Orchestrator loop caps (defaults 25 / 1800s). |
| `--stagnation-threshold` | Evaluated iterations with no criterion transition before terminating (default 3) — also the pool-exhaustion exit. |
| `--use-sampling` / `--no-sampling` | Force the advisory sampler on/off (default: auto-detect). |
| `--retries` | Sampled-plan retry budget before deterministic fallback (default 3). |
| `--save-plan PATH` | Also write the scaffolded plan JSON to `PATH`. |
| `--dry-run` | Canned-stub tool dispatcher — loop mechanics without live tools. |

#### `gco swarm start`

Validate the directive, criteria file (orchestrator criteria over the fleet
metrics — `metrics.children_completed`, `metrics.children_failed`,
`metrics.iteration_pool_remaining`, or predicates over `obs['children']`),
budget, and swarm rails, then persist a `pending` orchestrator session. The
persisted allowlist brackets any extra tools with the supervisor tools:
`children_status` first, `mission_spawn` / `child_abort` last.

- `--directive TEXT` (required), `--criteria-file PATH` (required)
- `--tool-allowlist NAME` (repeatable) / `--allow-all-tools`
- The same swarm-rail and budget options as `gco swarm run`.

#### `gco swarm iterate SESSION_ID`

Drive (or resume) an existing swarm's fleet. Also the crash-recovery path: a
fresh runner re-schedules every live child and evaluates restart policy for
children that went terminal while unsupervised. Exactly one live runner may
drive a swarm at a time — a second invocation refuses with
`swarm_runner_active` naming the holding PID.

- `--max-orchestrator-iterations N` — detach after `N` orchestrator
  iterations, leaving the fleet resumable (no abort cascade).
- `--dry-run` — canned-stub dispatcher.

#### `gco swarm status SESSION_ID`

One-call fleet rollup: orchestrator summary, swarm rails, iteration-pool
balance (`reserved` / `consumed` / `remaining`), runner heartbeat state,
slot-ordered child table, and a findings list (orphaned runner heartbeat,
unreadable children, exhausted pool). `--output table` renders a human
summary; the default is the JSON document.

#### `gco swarm abort SESSION_ID`

Terminate the orchestrator and abort every non-terminal child through the
standard abort transition, settling each slot's pool reservation. Works with
no live runner; a live runner observes the terminal orchestrator at its next
boundary and stands down.

#### `gco swarm list`

List swarm (orchestrator) sessions with child counts. `--status` filters by
lifecycle status. Child and standalone sessions never appear here — use
`gco mission list` for those.

#### `gco swarm scaffold-plan`

Draft an admission-validated Swarm_Plan from a directive without starting
anything — the review-then-run path. The plan is a JSON array of spawn
requests that are guaranteed to re-admit at spawn time against the same
rails and registered-tool set.

- `--directive TEXT` (required), `--tool-allowlist NAME` / `--allow-all-tools`
- `--max-plan-children N` — cap the sampled plan's fleet size.
- `--use-sampling` / `--no-sampling`, `--retries N`
- `--output-file PATH` — write the plan JSON to `PATH` instead of stdout.
- The same swarm-rail options as `gco swarm run` (the plan validates
  against them).

---

### Vector Commands

Semantic search over an S3-ingested document corpus, backed by the opt-in
**vector store**: a `{project}-vector-store` [DynamoDB global
table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html)
with a `corpus-embedding-index` vector index, replicated to every deployment
region so workloads and searches read locally. Ships with the global stack
when `vector_store.enabled` is `true` in `cdk.json` (**off by default** — a
replicated table carries real per-region cost). Ingestion is S3-driven:
objects dropped under the corpus prefix (default `vector-corpus/`) of the
cluster-shared bucket are chunked and embedded by the
`lambda/vector-ingest` Lambda automatically; `gco vector ingest` is a
convenience wrapper around that upload.

Corpus lifecycle notes: re-uploading a file overwrites its chunks in place
(deterministic ids), deleting an S3 object does **not** delete its items,
and adopting a newer `vector_store.embedding_model_id` means re-ingesting
the corpus — vectors are only comparable to vectors from the model that
wrote them. After the first enabled deploy the vector index takes several
minutes to build; searches answer a "still building" hint until it is
ACTIVE (`gco vector status` shows where things stand).

#### `gco vector status`

Show the table, replica, and vector-index state plus the resolved names.

```bash
gco vector status
gco vector status --region us-east-1 --output table
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--region` | Region whose replica to describe (default: the global region) |
| `--output` | Output format: `json` (default) or `table` |

#### `gco vector ingest`

Upload `.txt`/`.md`/`.jsonl` files to the corpus prefix for ingestion.
Uploading IS ingestion — the S3 event notification invokes the ingest
Lambda, and global-table replication fans the embedded chunks out to every
replica region. `.jsonl` files are pre-chunked (`{"text": "...", "title":
"optional"}` per line); `.txt`/`.md` go through the deterministic paragraph
chunker.

```bash
gco vector ingest docs/RUNBOOKS.md operations-notes.txt
gco vector ingest --demo --wait     # seed with the checkout's docs/*.md
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--demo` | Ingest the checkout's `docs/*.md` as a self-contained demo corpus (requires a source checkout) |
| `--wait` | Block until every uploaded document is searchable (up to 5 minutes); exits `1` if the wait times out |
| `--output` | Output format: `json` (default) or `table` |

#### `gco vector search`

Search the corpus for chunks similar to QUERY. The query is embedded with
the corpus's own model at the index width (both one-way doors), and a
lower score is closer under the default COSINE distance.

```bash
gco vector search "how do capacity blocks work"
gco vector search "spot interruption handling" --top-k 3 --output table
gco vector search "runbook steps" --source vector-corpus/RUNBOOKS.md --region us-east-1
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--top-k` | Number of similar chunks to return (default: 5) |
| `--source` | Only return chunks from this source document (full S3 key) |
| `--region` | Region whose replica to query (default: the global region) |
| `--output` | Output format: `json` (default) or `table` |

### Release Commands

Release validation lifecycle.

#### `gco release validate`

Run [live release validation](LIVE_RELEASE_VALIDATION.md) end to end with no interactive prompts. The command derives the expected commit SHA, branch, run id, and a private report directory outside the checkout, then executes `python -m scripts.live_release_validation` with the derived identity. Consent is expressed through explicit flags — there is deliberately nothing to confirm interactively, which makes the command scriptable while keeping accidental invocation implausible. The harness itself re-verifies every identity claim (account, SHA, branch, clean worktree, healthy `CDKToolkit` stacks) before acting. When `inference` or `all` is selected, preflight also requires `session-manager-plugin` on `PATH` before deployment. Separate digest-pinned vLLM and TGI images plus full immutable model revisions are mandatory; exact framework requests/responses, model-info probes, shared TLS proxy autoscaling, endpoint/HPA shape, and timeout contracts all belong to the main checkpoint identity.

```bash
gco release validate --expected-account 123456789012 \
  --i-understand-this-deploys-and-destroys-infrastructure \
  --confirm-kms-key-deletion \
  --inference-region us-east-1 \
  --inference-vllm-image 'registry.example/vllm@sha256:<64-lowercase-hex-digest>' \
  --inference-vllm-model-id publisher/vllm-model \
  --inference-vllm-model-revision '<40-lowercase-hex-model-commit>' \
  --inference-tgi-image 'registry.example/tgi@sha256:<64-lowercase-hex-digest>' \
  --inference-tgi-model-id publisher/tgi-model \
  --inference-tgi-model-revision '<40-lowercase-hex-model-commit>'
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--expected-account` | Required. Exact 12-digit AWS account id the run may touch; preflight fails on any mismatch with the caller identity. |
| `--i-understand-this-deploys-and-destroys-infrastructure` | Required consent flag: the run deploys real, paid infrastructure and destroys it afterwards. |
| `--confirm-kms-key-deletion` | Authorize scheduling this run's retained EKS KMS keys for their 7-day deletion window; required whenever the `deploy` action is selected. |
| `--actions` | Harness actions to run (default `all`); dependencies are added automatically. `all` includes first-class `inference` immediately after `topology`. A subset run reports `PARTIAL`, never `PASSED`. |
| `--inference-region` | Required when `inference` runs. One deployed Region used for all four strictly sequential scenarios. |
| `--inference-vllm-image` / `--inference-tgi-image` | Required. Separate immutable lowercase `@sha256:` server images; there are no mutable defaults. |
| `--inference-vllm-model-id` / `--inference-tgi-model-id` | Required. Exact model identifiers checked through framework-specific model-info APIs. |
| `--inference-vllm-model-revision` / `--inference-tgi-model-revision` | Required. Full lowercase 40-hex model commits forwarded to the official launchers and included in checkpoint identity. |
| `--inference-gpu-count` | GPUs per endpoint replica (default `0`); part of checkpoint identity. |
| `--profile` | Topology profile to validate against cdk.json: `configured` (default), `single-region`, or `multi-region`. |
| `--run-id` | Stable run id (default: UTC timestamp + commit SHA prefix). |
| `--report-dir` | Report directory (default: `~/gco-live-release-validation-reports/<run-id>`, outside the checkout so the clean-worktree preflight holds). |
| `--resume` | Resume an interrupted run; requires the original `--run-id` and `--report-dir`. |
| `--protected-stack` | Additional non-project CloudFormation stack to preserve exactly (repeatable). |
| `--emulator-endpoint` | Run the identical harness against a local AWS emulator ([Floci](FLOCI_TESTING.md)) instead of real AWS. The harness proves the endpoint is an emulator before touching anything. |

---

### Examples Commands

Validate the shipped example manifests under `examples/`.

#### `gco examples validate`

Run [example-job validation](EXAMPLE_VALIDATION.md): deploy the configured GCO topology (force-enabling any optional schedulers or infrastructure features the selected examples need), execute every selected example through its **documented** submission path (`gco jobs submit`/`submit-sqs`/`submit-direct`, `gco dag run`, or `kubectl apply` over the CLI's own SSM-tunnel machinery), verify per-example success criteria, clean each example up, destroy everything, and write per-example reports. `--static-only` runs the offline contract checks in seconds with no AWS access and no consent flags — it is the minimum bar for any change under `examples/` (CI enforces the same checks).

```bash
# Offline checks only (fast; no AWS):
gco examples validate --static-only

# Full live run of every example:
gco examples validate --expected-account 123456789012 \
  --i-understand-this-deploys-and-destroys-infrastructure \
  --confirm-kms-key-deletion

# Live-validate just the example you changed:
gco examples validate --examples gpu-job --expected-account 123456789012 \
  --i-understand-this-deploys-and-destroys-infrastructure \
  --confirm-kms-key-deletion
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--static-only` | Run only the offline checks (parse, transport-gate acceptance, namespace policy, spec/catalog symmetry) and exit; needs no account or consent flags. |
| `--expected-account` | Exact 12-digit AWS account id the run may touch (required for live runs). |
| `--i-understand-this-deploys-and-destroys-infrastructure` | Required consent flag for live runs. |
| `--confirm-kms-key-deletion` | Authorize scheduling this run's retained EKS KMS keys for their 7-day deletion window; required for live runs. |
| `--examples` | Only validate these examples (comma-separated file stems; default: all). Required helm charts and infrastructure features are derived from the selection. |
| `--skip-examples` | Exclude these examples from the selection. |
| `--max-parallel` | Maximum examples running concurrently in the examples action (default `0` = all selected at once; `1` = serial). Not part of the resume identity. |
| `--actions` | Harness actions to run (default `all`); dependencies are added automatically. |
| `--run-id` | Stable run id (default: UTC timestamp + commit SHA prefix). |
| `--report-dir` | Report directory (default: `~/gco-example-job-validation-reports/<run-id>`). |
| `--resume` | Resume an interrupted run; requires the original `--run-id` and `--report-dir`. |
| `--protected-stack` | Additional non-project CloudFormation stack to preserve exactly (repeatable). |

### Deps Commands

Dependency maintenance: reproduce the monthly `deps-scan` workflow's update
list on demand.

<details>
<summary>All <code>gco deps</code> commands (1) — click to expand</summary>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`gco deps scan`](#gco-deps-scan) | Generate the dependency update list the monthly deps-scan produces. |

</details>

#### `gco deps scan`

Run the repository's dependency scanner (`.github/scripts/dependency-scan.sh`
— the script behind the rolling "[Automated] Dependency updates available"
issue) and print its Markdown report. Surfaces that need AWS credentials or
missing host tools (`skopeo`, `helm`, `aws`, …) are skipped and flagged as
incomplete rather than failing, exactly as in CI. Requires a GCO checkout.

Heads-up: the full scan's Python surface runs `pip install -e ".[<extras>]"`
into the active environment (that is how it asks pip for outdated direct
pins). Run it from the dev container or a dedicated venv if that matters.

```bash
gco deps scan [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--nodepools-only` | Run only the accelerator-catalog / Karpenter NodePool freshness check (offline policy validation always; live EC2 catalog comparison when AWS credentials resolve). Fast, and the only network it may touch is EC2. |
| `--report FILE` | Write the Markdown report to `FILE` instead of stdout. |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Full scan; report to stdout, progress to stderr
gco deps scan

# Just the accelerator/NodePool registry freshness check
gco deps scan --nodepools-only

# Machine-readable envelope (has_drift, scan_complete, report_markdown) —
# the same shape the MCP deps_scan tool returns
gco -o json deps scan

# Save the report for a PR description
gco deps scan --report /tmp/dependency-report.md
```

## Configuration

### Config File

Create `~/.gco/config.yaml`:

```yaml
default_region: us-east-1
output_format: table
verbose: false
regions:
  - us-east-1
  - us-west-2
  - eu-west-1
```

### cdk.json

Project configuration in `cdk.json`:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "project_name": "gco",
    "deployment_regions": {
      "global": "us-east-2",
      "api_gateway": "us-east-2",
      "monitoring": "us-east-2",
      "regional": ["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]
    },
    "resource_thresholds": {
      "cpu_threshold": 80,
      "memory_threshold": 80,
      "gpu_threshold": -1,
      "pending_pods_threshold": 10,
      "pending_requested_cpu_vcpus": 100,
      "pending_requested_memory_gb": 200,
      "pending_requested_gpus": -1
    },
    "fsx_lustre": {
      "enabled": false,
      "storage_capacity_gib": 1200
    }
  }
}
```

Set any threshold to `-1` to disable that health check. This is useful when running GPU inference endpoints that naturally saturate GPU resources.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AWS_REGION` | Default AWS region |
| `AWS_PROFILE` | AWS credentials profile |
| `GCO_CONFIG` | Path to config file |
| `GCO_REGIONAL_API` | Use regional API endpoints (`true`/`false`) |
| `CDK_DOCKER` | Docker command (`docker` or `finch`) |
| `GCO_AUTOPILOT_ENGINE` | Select `claude-code` (default) or `codex`; top-level `--engine` wins. |
| `GCO_AUTOPILOT_MODEL` | Shared Bedrock model override: Claude uses it directly, and Codex uses it after `GCO_AUTOPILOT_CODEX_MODEL`; top-level `--model` wins. See [Autopilot](AUTOPILOT.md). |
| `GCO_AUTOPILOT_CODEX_MODEL` | Codex-specific Bedrock model override, ahead of the shared model variable. |
| `GCO_AUTOPILOT_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` | Optional Bedrock model for Claude Code's background/fast tasks (unset by default; rejected by Codex). |
| `GCO_AUTOPILOT_CONFIG_DIR` | Directory for generated Claude/Codex config and staged imports (default: `~/.gco/autopilot`; inside `gco-dev`, use a writable container path). |
| `GCO_AUTOPILOT_PLUGIN_DIRS` | Colon-separated Claude Code plugin dirs/zips loaded into every `gco autopilot` session (merged with per-launch `--plugin` flags; not forwarded across the dev-container boundary because host paths may not exist there). |
| `GCO_ENABLE_MISSION` | Gate the `gco mission` subcommand group (`true`/`false`). With the flag unset, every subcommand exits 2 with a hint. |
| `GCO_ENABLE_ALL_TOOLS` | Umbrella flag that satisfies every per-tool gate including `GCO_ENABLE_MISSION`. |
| `GCO_MISSION_STATE_BACKEND` | Persistence backend for sessions (`filesystem` or `dynamodb`). Unrecognised values fall back to filesystem with a one-line warning. |
| `GCO_MISSION_BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` | Override the `cdk.json` `context.bedrock.mission_default_model_id` used by the CLI sampling backend (stock value: Anthropic Claude Opus 5, `global.anthropic.claude-opus-5`). Explicit overrides do not inherit the stock `generation_reasoning.effort=high` field. See [Customization → Bedrock Model Selection](CUSTOMIZATION.md#bedrock-model-selection). |
| `GCO_MISSION_BEDROCK_REGION` | Override the default Bedrock region (`us-east-1`). |

## Examples

### Complete Workflow

```bash
# 1. Deploy (bootstrap runs automatically if needed)
export CDK_DOCKER=finch
gco stacks deploy-all -y

# 2. Check capacity
gco capacity status
gco capacity recommend-region --gpu

# 3. Submit jobs
gco jobs submit-sqs examples/simple-job.yaml --region us-east-1
gco jobs queue-status --all-regions

# 4. Monitor jobs
gco jobs list --all-regions
gco jobs logs my-job -r us-east-1 -n gco-jobs

# 5. Download outputs
gco files ls -r us-east-1
gco files download my-job/outputs ./results -r us-east-1

# 6. Cleanup
gco stacks destroy-all -y
```

### Inference Endpoint Workflow

```bash
# 1. Upload model weights
gco models upload ./llama3-weights/ --name llama3-8b

# 2. Deploy inference endpoint
gco inference deploy my-llm \
  -i vllm/vllm-openai:v0.28.0 \
  --gpu-count 1 \
  --model-source $(gco models uri llama3-8b) \
  -e MODEL=/models/my-llm \
  -r us-east-1

# 3. Monitor deployment
gco inference status my-llm

# 4. Scale for production
gco inference scale my-llm --replicas 3

# Or enable autoscaling
gco inference deploy my-llm \
  -i vllm/vllm-openai:v0.28.0 \
  --replicas 2 --gpu-count 1 \
  --min-replicas 1 --max-replicas 8 \
  --autoscale-metric cpu:70

# 5. Rolling update
gco inference update-image my-llm -i vllm/vllm-openai:v0.28.0

# 6. Cleanup
gco inference delete my-llm -y
gco models delete llama3-8b -y
```

### GPU Job Submission

```bash
# Check GPU capacity
gco capacity check -i g5.xlarge -r us-east-1

# Submit GPU job
gco jobs submit-sqs examples/gpu-job.yaml --auto-region

# Monitor
gco jobs list --all-regions
gco jobs logs gpu-test-job -r us-east-1 -n gco-jobs
```

### Multi-Region Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to multiple regions
gco stacks deploy-all -y --parallel --max-workers 4

# Check status across regions
gco stacks list
gco capacity status
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No credentials found"**

```bash
# Ensure AWS credentials are configured
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

**"Endpoint request timed out"**

- Wait 1-2 minutes after deployment for ALB targets to become healthy
- Use `submit-sqs` or `submit-direct` instead of `submit`

**"kubectl access denied"**

- Add your IAM principal to EKS access entries:

```bash
aws eks create-access-entry \
  --cluster-name gco-us-east-1 \
  --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:user/YOUR-USER \
  --region us-east-1

aws eks associate-access-policy \
  --cluster-name gco-us-east-1 \
  --principal-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:user/YOUR-USER \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:eks::aws:cluster-access-policy/AmazonEKSClusterAdminPolicy \
  --access-scope type=cluster \
  --region us-east-1
```

**"CDK bootstrap required"**

This should resolve automatically — `deploy` and `deploy-all` auto-bootstrap un-bootstrapped regions. If it persists:

```bash
gco stacks bootstrap --region us-east-1
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose output
gco -v jobs list --all-regions

# Check AWS configuration
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws eks list-clusters --region us-east-1
```
