## Deployment Regions

GCO deploys multiple stacks to configurable AWS Regions. Every configured Region must expose CloudFormation in the installed AWS SDK, and all Regions in one deployment must belong to the same AWS partition. There is no project-specific Region allowlist or count limit.

### Understanding Stack Regions

| Stack | Default Region | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| `gco-global` | us-east-2 | Partition-wide state and SSM coordination; [Global Accelerator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html) in commercial `aws` only |
| `gco-api-gateway` | us-east-2 | Edge-optimized workload + aggregate API in `aws`; regional aggregate-only API elsewhere |
| `gco-regional-api-{region}` | workload Region | Aggregator bridge; optional direct access in `aws`, required workload ingress elsewhere |
| `gco-monitoring` | us-east-2 | Cross-region CloudWatch dashboards and alarms |
| `gco-analytics` | API Gateway region | Optional SageMaker Studio and [EMR Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/emr-serverless.html) environment |
| `gco-{region}` | (configurable) | Regional EKS clusters, internal ALBs, and workload infrastructure |

**Why separate regions?**

- Partition-wide API and state resources are kept separate from workload Regions
- Prevents resource conflicts and simplifies management
- In commercial `aws`, Global Accelerator and the edge-optimized API provide the global workload path; other partitions use regional IAM-authenticated workload APIs
- Allows workload regions to be added/removed without affecting global infrastructure

### Configuring Deployment Regions

Edit `cdk.json` to customize where each stack type deploys:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "deployment_regions": {
      "global": "us-east-2",
      "api_gateway": "us-east-2",
      "monitoring": "us-east-2",
      "regional": [
        "us-east-1",
        "us-west-2",
        "eu-west-1"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Options:**

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `global` | string | `us-east-2` | Region for partition-wide state and SSM parameters; also homes Global Accelerator in `aws` |
| `api_gateway` | string | `us-east-2` | Region for API Gateway stack |
| `monitoring` | string | `us-east-2` | Region for Monitoring stack |
| `regional` | array | `["us-east-1"]` | Regions for EKS cluster deployment |

**Example: Deploy everything to us-west-2:**

```json
{
  "context": {
    "deployment_regions": {
      "global": "us-west-2",
      "api_gateway": "us-west-2",
      "monitoring": "us-west-2",
      "regional": ["us-west-2"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Example: Multi-region with EU compliance:**

```json
{
  "context": {
    "deployment_regions": {
      "global": "eu-west-1",
      "api_gateway": "eu-west-1",
      "monitoring": "eu-west-1",
      "regional": [
        "eu-west-1",
        "eu-central-1"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

The CLI also supports environment variables for region configuration:

```bash
# Override API Gateway region
export GCO_API_GATEWAY_REGION=us-west-2

# Override default region for CLI commands
export GCO_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2

# Override global region
export GCO_GLOBAL_REGION=us-west-2

# Override monitoring region
export GCO_MONITORING_REGION=us-west-2
```

**Configuration precedence (highest to lowest):**

1. Environment variables (`GCO_*`)
2. User config file (`~/.gco/config.yaml`)
3. Project config (`cdk.json`)
4. Default values

## Running Multiple Deployments in One Account and Region

`project_name` (in `cdk.json`) is the deployment's unique identifier. Every
physical resource name that must be unique per account+region — or globally —
is derived from it, so **changing `project_name` alone yields a fully isolated
deployment**. This lets you run two GCO deployments (for example `prod` and
`staging`, a blue/green pair, or per-team sandboxes) in the **same AWS account
and the same region(s)** without collisions.

```jsonc
// cdk.json — deployment A (the default)
{ "context": { "project_name": "gco", "deployment_regions": { "global": "us-east-2", "regional": ["us-east-1"] } } }

// cdk.json — deployment B, same account + same regions, no collision
{ "context": { "project_name": "gco-staging", "deployment_regions": { "global": "us-east-2", "regional": ["us-east-1"] } } }
```

Deploy each the usual way (`gco stacks deploy-all` or `cdk deploy --all`); the
two produce disjoint resource names and tear down independently
(`destroy-all` on one leaves the other intact).

> **One same-region caveat — ECR image replication.** Every *named* resource is
> project-scoped and coexists cleanly, but the ECR image-replication
> configuration created by the global stack is a per-account, per-region
> **singleton**: AWS allows only one `AWS::ECR::ReplicationConfiguration` per
> registry per region. So if two deployments place their **global** stack in the
> same region and both leave image replication on (`images.replication.enabled`,
> the default), the second stack fails to create it
> (`...ReplicationConfiguration...already exists`). Resolution: set
> `images.replication.enabled: false` on all but one same-region deployment (the
> others still get their own project-scoped `<project>/*` ECR repos — they just
> don't own that region's cross-region replication), **or** give each deployment
> a different global region. Deployments in different regions never conflict:
> each region has its own replication configuration with a project-scoped
> `<project>/` filter.

### What `project_name` scopes

Changing `project_name` re-scopes all of the following (shown for
`project_name = "acme"`):

| Resource | Name |
|---|---|
| CloudFormation stacks | `acme-global`, `acme-api-gateway`, `acme-<region>`, `acme-monitoring` |
| DynamoDB tables | `acme-jobs`, `acme-job-templates`, `acme-webhooks`, `acme-inference-endpoints`, … |
| Cluster-shared bucket + SSM | `acme-cluster-shared-<account>-<region>`, `/acme/cluster-shared-bucket/*` |
| Regional-shared bucket + SSM | `acme-regional-shared-<account>-<region>`, `/acme/regional-shared-bucket/*` |
| SSM registry | `/acme/jobs-table-name`, `/acme/model-bucket-name`, `/acme/alb-hostname-<region>`, … |
| API Gateway auth secret | `acme/api-gateway-auth-token` |
| WAF WebACL + log groups | `acme-api-gateway-waf`, `/aws/apigateway/acme-global`, `aws-waf-logs-acme-api-gateway` |
| CloudFormation exports | `acme-global-api-endpoint`, `acme-auth-secret-arn`, `acme-waf-webacl-arn`, … |
| ECR image namespace | repos under `acme/*` (e.g. `acme/dockerhub/…`), ECR replication filter `acme/`, `gco images` / mirror namespace |
| Global Accelerator (`aws` only) | `acme-accelerator` (defaults to `<project>-accelerator` when `global_accelerator.name` is unset in `cdk.json`) |
| API Gateway names | REST API `acme-global-api`, Studio Cognito authorizer `acme-studio-cognito-authorizer`, request validator `acme-studio-request-validator` |
| [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) cache (opt-in) | ElastiCache serverless cache `acme-<region>` |
| Analytics (opt-in) | Studio bucket `acme-analytics-studio-*`, SageMaker role `AmazonSageMaker-acme-analytics-exec-<region>`, Studio domain `acme-studio-<region>`, EMR app `acme-spark-<region>`, Cognito domain `acme-studio-<account>` |

The only names intentionally **not** re-scoped are in-cluster Kubernetes object
names (namespaces such as `gco-jobs` / `gco-system`, service accounts,
ConfigMaps): each deployment gets its own EKS cluster, so those live in
separate Kubernetes API servers and never collide across deployments.

### `project_name` format

Because the value flows into S3 bucket names and the Cognito domain prefix
(both lowercase-only, length-limited), it is validated at synth time and must
match:

```text
^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,30}$
```

That is: start with a lowercase letter, then 2–31 total characters of lowercase
letters, digits, or hyphens (e.g. `gco`, `gco-staging`, `acme`, `team-b-prod`).
Uppercase, underscores, dots, a leading digit, or a leading/trailing hyphen are
rejected up front with a clear error rather than failing mid-deploy.

### Backward compatibility

The default `project_name` is `gco`, and every derived name renders
**byte-for-byte identical** to earlier releases for that default. Upgrading an
existing `gco` deployment therefore renames (and replaces) no resource — verify
with `cdk diff` before deploying. The per-`project_name` no-collision guarantee
and the `gco` backward-compat guarantee are both enforced in CI by
`tests/test_project_name_scoping.py` (see the `unit:cdk:project-name-scoping`
job).

> Tracking: this scoping was completed in
> [issue #139](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/global-capacity-orchestrator-on-aws/issues/139).

## Adding Regions

### 1. Update CDK Configuration

Edit `cdk.json` to add new regional deployments:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "deployment_regions": {
      "global": "us-east-2",
      "api_gateway": "us-east-2",
      "monitoring": "us-east-2",
      "regional": [
        "us-east-1",
        "us-west-2",
        "eu-west-1",
        "ap-southeast-1"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Deploy to New Region

CDK bootstrap runs automatically during deploy if the new region hasn't been bootstrapped yet. Just deploy:

```bash
gco stacks deploy-all -y
```

If you prefer to bootstrap manually first:

```bash
gco stacks bootstrap -r ap-southeast-1
```

### 3. Verify Regional Routing

In the commercial `aws` partition, the new Region is automatically added to Global Accelerator and can be verified with:

```bash
aws globalaccelerator list-endpoint-groups \
  --listener-arn $(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name gco-global \
    --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`GlobalAcceleratorListenerArn`].OutputValue' \
    --output text)
```

In every other partition, no accelerator resources or outputs are created. Verify the new `<project>-regional-api-<region>` stack and its `RegionalApiEndpoint` output instead; that IAM-authenticated bridge is the supported workload ingress.

## EKS Cluster Configuration

### Endpoint Access Modes

GCO supports two EKS API endpoint access modes:

| Mode | Security | kubectl Access | Job Submission |
|------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| `PRIVATE` (default) | Most secure | Requires VPN/bastion/SSM | Via API Gateway or SQS |
| `PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE` | Less secure | Direct from internet | All methods |

**Recommendation:** Use `PRIVATE` for production environments. Job submission works seamlessly via the API Gateway or SQS queues, which are the recommended patterns anyway.

### Configuring Endpoint Access

Edit `cdk.json` to change the endpoint access mode:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "eks_cluster": {
      "endpoint_access": "PRIVATE"
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Options:**

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `PRIVATE` | EKS API only accessible from within VPC (default, most secure) |
| `PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE` | EKS API accessible from internet and VPC |

**Example: Enable public access for development:**

```json
{
  "context": {
    "eks_cluster": {
      "endpoint_access": "PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE",
      "public_access_cidrs": ["203.0.113.7/32"]
    }
  }
}
```

`public_access_cidrs` restricts who can reach the public endpoint. Leaving it
empty means `0.0.0.0/0` — synthesis prints a loud warning naming that exposure
rather than choosing it silently. Prefer the CLI, which refuses to widen
access without an explicit allowlist and records the change atomically:

```bash
gco stacks eks endpoint set PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE --cidr 203.0.113.7/32
gco stacks eks endpoint set PRIVATE -y     # back to the production posture
```

After changing, redeploy the regional stacks:

```bash
gco stacks deploy gco-us-east-1 -y
```

Until the deploy, `gco stacks status gco-us-east-1 -r us-east-1` reports the
configured-vs-live endpoint as config drift.

### Developer Access Entries

Reachability is only one of **three independent layers** — the cluster
authenticates through [EKS access entries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-entries.html),
and by default only the platform Lambda roles have one. A public endpoint or
an SSM tunnel without an access entry still fails with `Unauthorized`.

Two ways to grant a human principal access:

**One-shot, after deploy** (creates an access entry + associates the
cluster-admin policy for the caller):

```bash
gco stacks access -r us-east-1
```

**Declared at deploy time** in `cdk.json`, for grants that should survive
redeploys and be reviewable in config:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "eks_cluster": {
      "developer_access": [
        {"principal_arn": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/DeveloperRole"},
        {
          "principal_arn": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/alice",
          "scope": "namespace",
          "namespaces": ["gco-jobs", "gco-inference"]
        },
        {"principal_arn": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/PlatformAdmin", "scope": "cluster"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

- The default (`scope: namespace`, `namespaces: ["gco-jobs"]`) grants
  `AmazonEKSEditPolicy` scoped to the job namespace — enough to submit and
  inspect jobs, deliberately not cluster-admin.
- `scope: cluster` grants `AmazonEKSClusterAdminPolicy` explicitly.
- An absent or empty list changes nothing; invalid entries fail synthesis
  loudly instead of silently granting nothing.

Diagnose which layer is actually failing (reachability, authentication,
authorization, or a stale kubeconfig context) with:

```bash
gco cluster doctor --region us-east-1
```

### Job Submission with Private Endpoints

With `PRIVATE` endpoint access (the default), you have several secure options for submitting jobs:

**1. SQS Submission (Recommended)**

Submit jobs to a regional SQS queue - the most reliable method for region targeting:

```bash
# Submit to specific region
gco jobs submit-sqs examples/simple-job.yaml --region us-east-1

# Auto-select optimal region based on capacity
gco jobs submit-sqs examples/simple-job.yaml --auto-region
```

**2. API Gateway Submission**

Submit via the IAM-authenticated API Gateway:

```bash
gco jobs submit examples/simple-job.yaml
```

**3. Direct kubectl Access (requires network access to VPC)**

For direct kubectl access with private endpoints, you need network connectivity to the VPC:

- **AWS SSM Session Manager**: Connect to a bastion host or directly to nodes
- **VPN**: Site-to-site or client VPN to the VPC
- **Bastion Host**: EC2 instance in the VPC with kubectl configured
- **AWS Cloud9**: IDE in the VPC with kubectl access

The `gco cluster tunnel` command automates the SSM path end-to-end — it opens an
`AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost` tunnel to the private API endpoint
and prints the `kubectl` flags to use with it. `--via-ssm auto` even provisions a
self-terminating ephemeral bastion for the session (no new security group, no
inbound ports) and tears it down on exit:

```bash
# Auto-provision an ephemeral bastion, tunnel to the private API, and hold it open:
gco cluster tunnel --region us-east-1 --via-ssm auto

# In another shell, kubectl through the tunnel:
kubectl --server https://127.0.0.1:8443 --tls-server-name <endpoint-host> apply -f job.yaml

# Prefer to run it yourself? Print the exact commands (no changes made):
gco cluster tunnel --region us-east-1 --print
```

Or do it manually against your own SSM-managed instance:

```bash
# Example: Using SSM to port-forward to the cluster
aws ssm start-session --target i-bastion-instance-id

# Then on the bastion:
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name gco-us-east-1 --region us-east-1
kubectl apply -f job.yaml
```

See [`docs/CLI.md`](CLI.md#gco-cluster-tunnel) for the full `gco cluster tunnel`
reference.

## Configuring GPU Nodepools

### Modify Instance Types

Edit `lambda/kubectl-applier-simple/manifests/40-nodepool-gpu-x86.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  name: gpu-x86-pool
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      requirements:
        - key: eks.amazonaws.com/instance-family
          operator: In
          values:
            - g5      # NVIDIA A10G GPUs
            - g4dn    # NVIDIA T4 GPUs
            - p3      # NVIDIA V100 GPUs (add this)
            - p4d     # NVIDIA A100 GPUs (add this)
        
        - key: eks.amazonaws.com/instance-size
          operator: In
          values:
            - xlarge
            - 2xlarge
            - 4xlarge  # Add larger sizes
```

### Adjust GPU Limits

```yaml
spec:
  limits:
    cpu: "1000"
    memory: 1000Gi
    nvidia.com/gpu: "50"  # Increase GPU limit
```

### Configure Spot Instances

```yaml
spec:
  disruption:
    consolidationPolicy: WhenEmptyOrUnderutilized
    consolidateAfter: 30s
  
  template:
    spec:
      requirements:
        - key: karpenter.sh/capacity-type
          operator: In
          values:
            - spot        # Enable spot instances
            - on-demand   # Keep on-demand as fallback
```

### Add Taints for GPU Nodes

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      taints:
        - key: nvidia.com/gpu
          value: "true"
          effect: NoSchedule
```

Then use tolerations in your workloads:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: nvidia.com/gpu
      operator: Equal
      value: "true"
      effect: NoSchedule
  nodeSelector:
    eks.amazonaws.com/instance-family: g5
```

### Fractional / Shared GPUs

GCO runs on [EKS Auto Mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/automode.html), which ships the NVIDIA driver **and** device plugin built into the node (the plugin is not visible as a DaemonSet). GPU sharing via the device plugin's time-slicing ConfigMap is therefore not available: there is no cluster-managed device plugin to configure, and installing the community plugin alongside the built-in one does not work (it cannot initialize NVML on Auto Mode nodes and crash-loops).
For workloads that don't need a full dedicated GPU, use the fractional-GPU instance sizes already present in the default `gpu-x86-pool` (`g6f` / `gr6f` expose a slice of an L4 as a whole `nvidia.com/gpu` unit), or right-size onto the smallest suitable family (e.g. `g4dn.xlarge`). Constrain placement with `eks.amazonaws.com/instance-family` node selectors as shown above.

## Customizing Services

### Health Monitor

#### Resource Thresholds

The health monitor compares cluster utilization against configurable thresholds in `cdk.json`. When any threshold is exceeded, the cluster reports as `unhealthy`.

```json
"resource_thresholds": {
  "cpu_threshold": 80,
  "memory_threshold": 80,
  "gpu_threshold": -1,
  "pending_pods_threshold": 10,
  "pending_requested_cpu_vcpus": 100,
  "pending_requested_memory_gb": 200,
  "pending_requested_gpus": -1
}
```

| Threshold | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `cpu_threshold` | 80 | CPU utilization % (0-100, or -1 to disable) |
| `memory_threshold` | 80 | Memory utilization % (0-100, or -1 to disable) |
| `gpu_threshold` | -1 | GPU utilization % (0-100, or -1 to disable) |
| `pending_pods_threshold` | 10 | Max pending pods before unhealthy (-1 to disable) |
| `pending_requested_cpu_vcpus` | 100 | Max vCPUs requested by pending pods (-1 to disable) |
| `pending_requested_memory_gb` | 200 | Max GB memory requested by pending pods (-1 to disable) |
| `pending_requested_gpus` | -1 | Max GPUs requested by pending pods (-1 to disable) |

Set a threshold to `-1` to disable that check entirely. GPU thresholds are disabled by default because inference endpoints naturally saturate GPU resources and should not trigger unhealthy status.

After changing thresholds, redeploy the regional stack:

```bash
gco stacks deploy gco-us-east-1 -y
```

#### Custom Health Checks

Edit `gco/services/health_monitor.py`:

```python
# Add custom health checks
@app.get("/healthz/custom")
async def custom_health_check():
    # Your custom logic
    return {"status": "healthy", "custom_metric": 42}
```

Rebuild and redeploy:

```bash
# Rebuild and deploy
gco stacks deploy-all -y
```

#### Global Accelerator Health Check

Global Accelerator uses HTTP health checks to determine if a region is healthy. The health check path is configured in `cdk.json`:

```json
"global_accelerator": {
  "health_check_path": "/api/v1/health",
  "health_check_interval": 30,
  "health_check_threshold": 3,
  "client_affinity": "NONE"
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `health_check_path` | `/api/v1/health` | HTTPS path GA uses to check ALB health. Must be in `UNAUTHENTICATED_PATHS` in `gco/services/auth_middleware.py` |
| `health_check_interval` | `30` | Seconds between health checks. The Global Accelerator API accepts only `10` or `30`; anything else fails at synth |
| `health_check_threshold` | `3` | Consecutive health checks (1-10) before an endpoint flips healthy/unhealthy |
| `client_affinity` | `NONE` | Listener client affinity. `NONE` spreads connections across endpoints for even load distribution; `SOURCE_IP` pins each client IP to the same endpoint for session stickiness |

The block merges over the shipped defaults, so a partial block keeps every
unspecified default. The legacy `health_check_grace_period` and
`health_check_timeout` keys are tolerated and ignored — Global Accelerator
endpoint groups have no such settings (the keys were never consumed); remove
them from existing configs at your convenience.

The `/api/v1/health` endpoint returns 200 when the cluster is within resource thresholds and 503 when overloaded. This enables intelligent routing — GA automatically routes traffic away from overloaded regions.

The health check path must be listed in `UNAUTHENTICATED_PATHS` in `gco/services/auth_middleware.py` so Global Accelerator can probe it without a per-request HMAC envelope. A CI test (`tests/test_health_check_coverage.py`) validates this automatically.

#### Client Affinity

Global Accelerator listeners support two client-affinity modes, controlled by the `client_affinity` knob under `global_accelerator` in `cdk.json`:

- `NONE` (default): GA may route each new connection to any healthy endpoint. This maximizes even load distribution across regions and is the right choice for stateless request/response traffic.
- `SOURCE_IP`: GA pins connections from the same source IP to the same endpoint group for as long as it stays healthy. Use this when a workload keeps per-client state on a single region (for example, sticky sessions). Note that affinity is broken when an endpoint becomes unhealthy or the endpoint set changes.

The value is validated at synth time — anything other than `NONE` or `SOURCE_IP` raises a `ConfigValidationError`. See the [AWS Global Accelerator client affinity docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-listeners.html#about-listeners-client-affinity) for details.

#### Traffic Dial Controller

Each regional endpoint group has a `TrafficDialPercentage` — the share of new
connections Global Accelerator admits to that region relative to optimal
routing, with the remainder redirected to the next-closest region. The
optional traffic-dial controller (an EventBridge-scheduled Lambda in the
global stack, commercial `aws` partition only) converges each region's dial
toward its cluster's `ClusterHealthy` signal, so a region whose GPU pools are
degraded sheds new traffic gradually instead of waiting for a binary
health-check failover:

```json
"global_accelerator": {
  "traffic_dial": {
    "enabled": false,
    "mode": "monitor",
    "interval_minutes": 5,
    "lookback_minutes": 15,
    "min_dial_percentage": 10,
    "max_step_percentage": 20,
    "full_health_percentage": 95
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `false` | Deploy the controller (opt-in) |
| `mode` | `monitor` | `monitor` computes and publishes decisions (CloudWatch `GCO/TrafficDial` metrics plus the `/{project}/traffic-dial/state` SSM parameter) without touching Global Accelerator; `enforce` additionally applies them via `UpdateEndpointGroup`. Only `enforce` mode is granted that IAM action |
| `interval_minutes` | `5` | Controller run cadence (1-1440) |
| `lookback_minutes` | `15` | Health window averaged per region (1-1440) |
| `min_dial_percentage` | `10` | Floor a degraded region can be dialed down to (0-100) |
| `max_step_percentage` | `20` | Largest dial change one run may apply, in either direction (1-100) |
| `full_health_percentage` | `95` | Healthy percent at or above which a region is restored toward 100 (1-100) |

Safety rails: missing telemetry holds the current dial (an absent signal is
neither health nor degradation), a last-healthy-region guard never leaves
every endpoint group dialed below 100, cycles are skipped while the
accelerator is mid-deployment, and per-region manual overrides
(`gco capacity traffic-dial set` / `clear`) always win. Run the controller in
`monitor` mode first and watch the `GCO/TrafficDial` metrics before promoting
to `enforce`. Existing connections are never terminated by a dial change —
only new connections are steered.

The controller state and any manual overrides live as runtime SSM parameters
under `/{project}/traffic-dial` (written outside CloudFormation). A fully
successful `gco stacks destroy-all` purges that tree so a stale override
cannot silently pin a region's dial in the account's next deployment.

#### Inference Health Watchdog

The inference monitor tracks how long each endpoint has zero ready replicas. Inference traffic uses the shared Gateway API route but terminates at the dedicated authenticated inference-proxy service, so an individual model does not own an ALB target group and the watchdog never changes shared ALB rules.

Configure in `cdk.json`:

```json
"inference_monitor": {
  "reconcile_interval": 15,
  "unhealthy_threshold_seconds": 300
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `reconcile_interval` | `15` | Seconds between reconciliation cycles |
| `unhealthy_threshold_seconds` | `300` | Seconds at zero ready replicas before the monitor emits an explicit degraded-state warning |

Before the threshold, the monitor records the start of the outage. After the threshold, it logs that the authenticated inference proxy will return 503 until the model recovers. When a replica becomes ready, the timer is cleared. Reconciliation never creates endpoint-specific public routes.

#### Inference Proxy TLS Autoscaling

Configure the shared inference data plane's `api-tls-proxy` CPU request and
HPA target in `cdk.json`:

```json
"inference_proxy": {
  "tls_proxy_cpu_request_millicores": 100,
  "tls_proxy_cpu_target_utilization_percentage": 70
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tls_proxy_cpu_request_millicores` | `100` | Exact integer from 1 through 250. CDK renders it as a Kubernetes CPU quantity such as `100m`; this request is the TLS sidecar HPA utilization denominator |
| `tls_proxy_cpu_target_utilization_percentage` | `70` | Exact integer from 1 through 100 used only by the `api-tls-proxy` CPU `ContainerResource` HPA signal |

The section is optional. Omission and JSON `null` use both defaults because AWS
CDK normalizes top-level `null` context values to omission; partial objects retain
the other default. Unknown keys, non-object non-null sections, booleans, floats,
strings, and out-of-range values fail configuration validation. Redeploy the
regional stack after changing a value. This tuning does not change the inference
application CPU or memory, the TLS proxy CPU limit or memory profile, HPA replica
bounds or behavior, the PodDisruptionBudget, or stream-drain settings.

#### ALB Architecture

GCO uses one internal application ALB per region, created by the AWS Load Balancer Controller from the `gco-system/gco-gateway` Gateway API resources. The shared `HTTPRoute` sends health and control-plane traffic to their platform services and `/inference/*` to the dedicated inference proxy. The proxy authenticates and validates an inference route before streaming from the selected endpoint's ClusterIP Service, so endpoint Deployments and Services do not create public or endpoint-specific routes.

The GA registration Lambda resolves the ALB from the Gateway status address (with an exact `gco.aws/gateway` + cluster ownership-tag fallback) and verifies its type (`application`) and scheme (`internal`) before publishing its hostname and registering it. It also removes stale Global Accelerator endpoint attachments so only the current verified platform ALB remains registered.

### Manifest Processor

Edit `gco/services/manifest_processor.py`:

```python
# Add custom validation
def validate_manifest(manifest: dict) -> bool:
    # Your custom validation logic
    if "custom_field" not in manifest:
        raise ValueError("Missing custom_field")
    return True
```

## Security Policy Configuration

The shared `job_validation_policy` section in `cdk.json` includes a `manifest_security_policy` object, an `allowed_namespaces` list, and an `allowed_kinds` list that control which Kubernetes manifest patterns are accepted or rejected. The stock namespace allowlist is only `gco-jobs`, matching the deployed namespace-scoped write Role; adding another namespace also requires an intentionally scoped Role/RoleBinding there.

This policy is enforced on **both** submission paths:

- the REST manifest processor (`POST /api/v1/manifests`)
- the SQS queue processor (`gco jobs submit-sqs`)

CDK wires the same configuration values into both services at deploy time, so a single policy change applies uniformly. An attacker holding `sqs:SendMessage` on the job queue cannot use the SQS path to bypass the checks enforced by the REST path.

> **To read what a region actually enforces, don't read this file — ask the cluster.** `gco jobs policy --region <region>` (or `GET /api/v1/policy`) returns the deployed policy, plus the namespace `LimitRange` and `ResourceQuota` ceilings that form the second and third admission layers. `cdk.json` is the *input* to a deploy: it drifts the moment a stack is deployed from a different checkout, and CDK adds the project's own ECR registries to `trusted_registries` at synth time, so the effective allowlist is always larger than what you see here. See [Reading the deployed validation policy](API.md#reading-the-deployed-validation-policy).

Policy values in `cdk.json` must be literal JSON booleans (`true` or `false`). Nulls, strings, numbers, unknown policy fields, and malformed `require_accelerator_toleration` values are rejected before synthesis rather than being converted by truthiness. At runtime, the generated `BLOCK_*`, `REQUIRE_ACCELERATOR_TOLERATION`, and `VALIDATION_ENABLED` variables accept explicit `true`/`false`, `1`/`0`, `yes`/`no`, or `on`/`off` spellings (case-insensitive); unset or blank variables retain their documented defaults. Any other non-empty value, including a typo or unresolved placeholder, fails service startup instead of disabling a control.

### Security Policy Toggles

Each toggle controls a specific security check. Set a toggle to `false` to allow the corresponding pattern, or `true` to block it.

```json
"job_validation_policy": {
  "manifest_security_policy": {
    "block_privileged": true,
    "block_privilege_escalation": true,
    "block_host_network": true,
    "block_host_pid": true,
    "block_host_ipc": true,
    "block_host_path": true,
    "block_added_capabilities": true,
    "block_run_as_root": false
  }
}
```

| Toggle | Default | What It Controls |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `block_privileged` | `true` | Rejects containers with `securityContext.privileged: true` |
| `block_privilege_escalation` | `true` | Rejects containers with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: true` |
| `block_host_network` | `true` | Rejects pods with `hostNetwork: true` |
| `block_host_pid` | `true` | Rejects pods with `hostPID: true` |
| `block_host_ipc` | `true` | Rejects pods with `hostIPC: true` |
| `block_host_path` | `true` | Rejects pods with `hostPath` volumes |
| `block_added_capabilities` | `true` | Rejects containers with `capabilities.add` entries |
| `block_run_as_root` | `false` | Rejects containers or pods with `runAsUser: 0` |

`block_run_as_root` defaults to `false` because many GPU and ML container images require root. Enable it if your security posture requires non-root execution.

**Example: Allow runAsUser: 0**

Many GPU containers (NVIDIA CUDA, PyTorch) run as root by default. The default configuration already allows this (`block_run_as_root: false`). If you previously enabled it and need to revert:

```json
"manifest_security_policy": {
  "block_run_as_root": false
}
```

### Allowed Resource Kinds

The `allowed_kinds` list controls which Kubernetes resource kinds can be submitted through the manifest processor. Manifests with a `kind` not in this list are rejected.

```json
"job_validation_policy": {
  "allowed_kinds": ["Job", "CronJob", "Deployment", "StatefulSet", "DaemonSet", "Service", "ConfigMap", "Pod", "TrainJob"]
}
```

The default list covers the most common workload and service types, plus the Kubeflow Trainer v2 `TrainJob` (pinned to `trainer.kubeflow.org/v1alpha1`; requires the `kubeflow_trainer` Helm chart, enabled by default). Modify it to match your needs.

**Example: Restrict to only Jobs**

If your platform only runs batch workloads:

```json
"allowed_kinds": ["Job"]
```

All other kinds (Deployment, Service, etc.) will be rejected.

**Example: Add a custom kind like NetworkPolicy**

If you need users to submit NetworkPolicy resources:

```json
"allowed_kinds": ["Job", "CronJob", "Deployment", "StatefulSet", "DaemonSet", "Service", "ConfigMap", "Pod", "TrainJob", "NetworkPolicy"]
```

After changing any security policy or allowed_kinds settings, redeploy the regional stack:

> **Note:** These settings apply to the **manifest processor** and **queue processor** validation layers. They do not affect containers or resources created outside the job submission APIs (e.g., by platform operators via kubectl directly or by Helm charts).

```bash
gco stacks deploy gco-us-east-1 -y
```

### Adjust Replica Counts

Edit the deployment manifests:

`lambda/kubectl-applier-simple/manifests/30-health-monitor.yaml`:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 5  # Increase from 2 to 5
```

Or use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: health-monitor-hpa
  namespace: gco-system
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: health-monitor
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
```

## Adding Kubernetes Manifests

Manifests are applied in sorted filename order. The naming convention encodes both
the deployment phase and the resource group:

```text
NN-group-name.yaml      # Main pass (applied before Helm)
post-helm-name.yaml     # Post-Helm pass (applied after Helm installs CRDs)
```

**Number ranges:**

- `00-19` — Foundation & networking (namespaces, service accounts, RBAC, network policies)
- `20-29` — Storage (EFS, FSx, Valkey)
- `30-39` — System services (health-monitor, manifest-processor, inference-monitor)
- `40-49` — NodePools (GPU, [EFA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html), Neuron, CPU)
- `50-59` — Device plugins (NVIDIA)
- `post-helm-*` — Resources requiring Helm CRDs (Gateway API entrypoint, [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) ScaledJob, etc.)

**Optional features:** Files with unresolved uppercase `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` feature gates are skipped. For shipped optional features, the applier also prunes an exact, audited list of resources previously owned by that feature. It does not use broad label deletion, so unrelated resources are left untouched. When adding a new optional platform feature, add its exact owned-resource inventory to the applier so disable-time convergence is explicit.

See `lambda/kubectl-applier-simple/manifests/README.md` for the full file listing.

### 1. Create Your Manifest

Create a new manifest named 33-my-service.yaml in the existing `lambda/kubectl-applier-simple/manifests/` directory:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-service
  namespace: gco-system
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-service
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: gco-service-account
      containers:
        - name: my-service
          image: {{MY_SERVICE_IMAGE}}  # Placeholder for CDK
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
  namespace: gco-system
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-service
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

### 2. Add Image to CDK Stack

Edit `gco/stacks/regional_stack.py`:

```python
# In _create_container_images method
self.my_service_image = ecr_assets.DockerImageAsset(
    self, "MyServiceImage",
    directory=".",
    file="path/to/my-service-dockerfile",
    platform=ecr_assets.Platform.LINUX_AMD64
)

# In _create_kubectl_lambda method, add to ImageReplacements
"ImageReplacements": {
    "{{HEALTH_MONITOR_IMAGE}}": self.health_monitor_image.image_uri,
    "{{MANIFEST_PROCESSOR_IMAGE}}": self.manifest_processor_image.image_uri,
    "{{MY_SERVICE_IMAGE}}": self.my_service_image.image_uri,  # Add this
    ...
}
```

### 3. Rebuild Lambda Package

```bash
rm -rf lambda/kubectl-applier-simple-build
mkdir -p lambda/kubectl-applier-simple-build
cp lambda/kubectl-applier-simple/handler.py lambda/kubectl-applier-simple-build/
cp -r lambda/kubectl-applier-simple/manifests lambda/kubectl-applier-simple-build/
pip3 install kubernetes pyyaml urllib3 -t lambda/kubectl-applier-simple-build/
```

### 4. Deploy

```bash
gco stacks deploy-all -y
```

## Modifying Network Configuration

### Availability Zone coverage

Each regional VPC spans **every** Availability Zone in its region: `max_azs=99` in
`gco/stacks/regional_stack.py` is the CDK idiom for "use all AZs", and each AZ gets
one public and one private subnet (so a 6-AZ region such as `us-east-1` yields 12
subnets). CDK can only enumerate a region's real AZ list when the stack is
environment-specific, so `app.py` sets each stack's account from
`CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` — which the CDK CLI populates automatically from your active
credentials at `gco stacks` / `cdk` time. To pin a fixed number of AZs instead,
lower `max_azs` (e.g. `max_azs=3`).

### Change VPC CIDR

Edit `gco/stacks/regional_stack.py`:

```python
self.vpc = ec2.Vpc(
    self,
    "GCOVpc",
    vpc_name=f"{config.get_project_name()}-vpc-{region}",
    max_azs=99,  # span every AZ in the region (lower this to cap AZ count)
    ip_addresses=ec2.IpAddresses.cidr("10.1.0.0/16"),  # Custom CIDR
    nat_gateways=2,
    subnet_configuration=[
        ec2.SubnetConfiguration(
            name="PublicSubnet", subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC, cidr_mask=24
        ),
        ec2.SubnetConfiguration(
            name="PrivateSubnet",
            subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS,
            cidr_mask=22,  # Larger subnets for more IPs
        ),
    ],
)
```

### Add VPC Endpoints

```python
# Add S3 endpoint
self.vpc.add_gateway_endpoint("S3Endpoint", service=ec2.GatewayVpcEndpointAwsService.S3)

# Add ECR endpoints
self.vpc.add_interface_endpoint("EcrEndpoint", service=ec2.InterfaceVpcEndpointAwsService.ECR)
```

### Modify Security Groups

The platform ALB and its security group are created by the AWS Load Balancer Controller from the `gco-system/gco-gateway` Gateway API resources; there is no `alb_security_group` CDK construct to edit in `regional_stack.py`. Keep the platform Gateway internal (`LoadBalancerConfiguration.spec.scheme: internal`) and make network changes through the Gateway API configuration in `post-helm-gateway.yaml`, VPC routing, and Kubernetes NetworkPolicies. After any change, verify that Global Accelerator health checks can still reach `/api/v1/health` and that direct unsigned backend requests remain rejected.

## Adjusting Resource Limits

### Pod Resource Requests/Limits

Edit deployment manifests:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    - name: health-monitor
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "500m"      # Increase from 100m
          memory: "512Mi"  # Increase from 128Mi
        limits:
          cpu: "2000m"     # Increase from 500m
          memory: "2Gi"    # Increase from 512Mi
```

### nodepool Limits

Edit nodepool manifests:

```yaml
spec:
  limits:
    cpu: "2000"      # Total CPUs across all nodes
    memory: 2000Gi   # Total memory
```

### Lambda Configuration

Edit `gco/stacks/regional_stack.py`:

```python
kubectl_lambda = lambda_.Function(
    self, "KubectlApplierFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.PYTHON_3_14,
    handler="handler.lambda_handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset("lambda/kubectl-applier-simple-build"),
    timeout=Duration.minutes(10),  # Increase from 5
    memory_size=1024,              # Increase from 512
    ...
)
```

## Workload CloudWatch Metrics

Job and inference pods run as `gco-service-account` (the shared Pod Identity
role — the only identity with read/write on the regional shared bucket and
its KMS key). That role may publish CloudWatch metrics with
`cloudwatch:PutMetricData`, scoped by an IAM condition to exactly one
namespace:

```json
{
  "workload_metrics": {
    "cloudwatch_namespace": "GCO/Workloads"
  }
}
```

- The default is the GCO-owned `GCO/Workloads` namespace. Point it at your
  own namespace if your training code already emits somewhere specific
  (for example `Acme/Training`).
- The grant is namespace-conditioned, not resource-scoped —
  `PutMetricData` does not support resource-level permissions, so the
  `cloudwatch:namespace` condition carries the whole restriction. Pods
  cannot write to any other namespace, including the `GCO/*` platform
  namespaces used by the health monitor and manifest processor.
- Apply with `gco stacks deploy <project>-<region> -y` per regional stack.

From a training pod, publishing works with the standard SDK call:

```python
import boto3

boto3.client("cloudwatch").put_metric_data(
    Namespace="GCO/Workloads",
    MetricData=[{"MetricName": "loss", "Value": 0.42}],
)
```

## Helm Chart Configuration

GCO installs add-ons in dependency order through the Helm installer. KEDA is a mandatory platform component because it backs the built-in SQS consumer and external-metrics path. The remaining scheduler and device-plugin charts are controlled under `helm`; in-cluster observability is controlled separately by `cluster_observability.enabled`.

```json
{
  "context": {
    "cluster_observability": { "enabled": true },
    "helm": {
      "aws_efa_device_plugin": { "enabled": true },
      "aws_neuron_device_plugin": { "enabled": true },
      "volcano": { "enabled": true },
      "kuberay": { "enabled": true },
      "cert_manager": { "enabled": true },
      "slurm": { "enabled": false },
      "yunikorn": { "enabled": false },
      "kubeflow_trainer": { "enabled": true },
      "kueue": { "enabled": true }
    }
  }
}
```

| Chart | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| KEDA | Mandatory | Event-driven autoscaling and the external-metrics bridge; always installed |
| AWS EFA device plugin | Enabled | EFA device management for high-performance networking |
| AWS Neuron device plugin | Enabled | [Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/)/Inferentia device management |
| [Volcano](https://volcano.sh/) | Enabled | Gang scheduling for distributed training |
| [KubeRay](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/index.html) | Enabled | Ray distributed computing operator |
| [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) | Enabled | Certificate management for cluster webhooks |
| [Kubeflow Trainer](https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer) | Enabled | Trainer v2 controller + JobSet for `TrainJob` distributed training — see the [Distributed Training Guide](DISTRIBUTED_TRAINING.md) |
| kube-prometheus-stack | Enabled | [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/), Alertmanager, and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/) when `cluster_observability.enabled` is true |
| [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) | Enabled | Experiment tracking server when `cluster_observability.enabled` AND `cluster_observability.mlflow.enabled` are true — see [MONITORING.md](MONITORING.md#mlflow-experiment-tracking) |
| Slurm/Slinky | Disabled | Slurm operator and cluster |
| [YuniKorn](https://yunikorn.apache.org/) | Disabled | App-aware scheduler with hierarchical queues |
| [Kueue](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/) | Enabled | Job queueing with quotas and fair sharing; installed last |

Disabling `helm.kubeflow_trainer` uninstalls the trainer on the next deploy, prunes the shipped `torch-distributed` runtime, and makes `TrainJob` submissions fail with an actionable enable-the-addon message (the kind stays in the [allowed-kinds policy](#allowed-resource-kinds); the addon gate is what rejects it). Disabling `cluster_observability.mlflow` removes the tracking server and deletes its run-metadata volume; artifacts in S3 survive.

Disable optional charts you do not use to reduce system-node overhead and deployment time. KEDA cannot be disabled without replacing platform features that depend on it.

> **⚠️ Helm charts install asynchronously — give them time to finish.**
>
> Chart installation is **deliberately decoupled from the CloudFormation deploy**. When `gco stacks deploy-all` reports the regional stack as `CREATE_COMPLETE`, that means the install has been *kicked off* — not that every chart is ready. The charts are then installed one at a time by a Step Functions state machine in the background, and full convergence can take **10–30+ minutes** depending on how many charts are enabled and how fast their images pull (some third-party images come from `docker.io` and can be slow, e.g. Volcano).
>
> After post-Helm apply, exhaustive manifest validation is read-only and retries snapshots on a bounded 1/2/3-minute backoff schedule through roughly 21 minutes. This gives cold cert-manager Secret issuance, EKS Auto Mode node provisioning, PDBs, and EndpointSlices time to converge without replaying any Kubernetes mutations. Persistent readiness, schema, or access failures still fail the exact background execution with object-level evidence.
>
> This is intentional: a slow or failing chart must **never** roll back and destroy the freshly-created EKS cluster. Each chart installs independently — one slow or broken chart does not block the rest.
>
> Monitor convergence and inspect per-chart results at any time:
>
> ```bash
> # Per-chart status (reads the status each chart task records in SSM)
> gco stacks addons status -r <region>
> gco stacks addons status --all-regions
> ```
>
> If a chart shows as failed (for example, a transient image-pull timeout), re-converge the add-on layer without touching the cluster:
>
> ```bash
> gco stacks addons install -r <region>
> gco stacks addons install --all-regions
> ```
>
> Workloads that depend on a specific scheduler/operator (Volcano, Kueue, KubeRay, etc.) should wait until that chart shows `installed` before they are submitted.

See [Schedulers & Orchestrators](SCHEDULERS.md) for detailed guidance on each tool.

### Get Volcano's docker.io images off the rate-limited path (ECR mirror)

A few add-on charts pull their images directly from Docker Hub (`docker.io`) — most notably **Volcano** (`volcanosh/vc-*`). On a cold cluster those anonymous pulls are slow and subject to Docker Hub rate limits, which can make Volcano's install time out and retry. GCO can mirror those images into the project's **own ECR** (under the `gco/*` prefix) and point Volcano at the mirror, so the cluster makes fast, same-account ECR pulls with the pull-only node role it already has. This is **on by default** and needs **no Docker Hub credential** — it's a static mirror you refresh when the chart version changes.

> **Why a mirror and not an ECR pull-through cache?** ECR pull-through cache for Docker Hub *requires* a stored Docker Hub credential (anonymous Docker Hub PTC isn't supported), and on EKS Auto Mode the pull-only, service-managed node role complicates cache-miss imports. Mirroring sidesteps both: no credential, and the images are plain `gco/*` ECR repos the nodes can already pull.

When enabled, the regional stack injects one Volcano value override — `basic.image_registry` → `<account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.<url-suffix>/<ecr_namespace>` — so every Volcano image (controller, scheduler, admission webhook, and the pre-install admission-init hook, which all render from `basic.image_registry`) resolves from ECR. It creates **no** CloudFormation resources; the mirror is populated by `gco stacks deploy` (automatically, see below) or the `gco images mirror` CLI.

**1. Default `cdk.json` config** (on by default; the default `ecr_namespace` of `gco/dockerhub` is fine). To disable, set `enabled` to `false`:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "volcano_image_mirror": {
      "enabled": true,
      "ecr_namespace": "gco/dockerhub"
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Deploy.** `gco stacks deploy <stack>` / `deploy-all` **auto-mirrors** the images into ECR (per region) right before the regional stack's Helm install — so a fresh install just works, with no separate step. The copy is idempotent and skips images already present, so repeat deploys cost only a couple of ECR lookups. From a machine with a container runtime (Docker Buildx, [Finch](https://runfinch.com/), or [skopeo](https://github.com/podman-container-tools/skopeo)) and AWS credentials; the source pull from Docker Hub is anonymous and one-time.

**3. Converge / check.** If Volcano had previously failed, re-converge without touching the cluster:

```bash
gco stacks addons install -r <region>
gco stacks addons status -r <region>
```

**Mirror manually (optional).** To pre-seed a region before enabling, or to re-mirror after a version bump, run the CLI directly:

```bash
gco images mirror --region us-east-1
gco images mirror --region us-east-1 --dry-run   # preview only
```

It reads the image set and pinned tag from `lambda/helm-installer/charts.yaml`, creates the `gco/<...>` ECR repositories if needed, and copies each image preserving the **full multi-arch manifest list** (via `docker buildx imagetools create`, Finch `--all-platforms`, or `skopeo copy --all`, whichever the runtime supports) — so both amd64 and arm64 (Graviton) nodes find a matching image. A plain `docker pull`/`push` would drop every architecture except the build host's, so it is never used.

Notes:

- `ecr_namespace` must start with `gco/` so it inherits the project's `gco/*` node-pull access, ECR replication, and trusted-registry allow-list. The toggle is validated at synth time — an `ecr_namespace` outside `gco/` or an invalid ECR path fails fast.
- If an enabled mirror can't complete during deploy (no container runtime, network, credentials), the deploy aborts **before** CloudFormation rather than bringing up a cluster whose Volcano images aren't in ECR.
- It's a **static** mirror: when you bump the Volcano chart `version`/`image_tag_version` in `charts.yaml`, the next `gco stacks deploy` re-mirrors the new tag (or run `gco images mirror` to do it out-of-band).
- This only changes where images are *pulled from* — Volcano's behavior and versions are unchanged.
- The mirror is a **general** tool — to mirror another chart's docker.io-only image down the road, see "HOW TO ADD AN IMAGE TO THE MIRROR" in `cli/_image_mirror.py`.

For the full reference — architecture, the multi-arch copy strategy, the MCP tools (`images_mirror_plan` / `images_mirror_status` / `images_mirror`), troubleshooting, and how to add another chart's image — see [Image Mirror](IMAGE_MIRROR.md).

## Enabling Additional Features

### Enable EKS Logging

Edit `gco/stacks/regional_stack.py`:

```python
self.cluster = eks.Cluster(
    self,
    "GCOEksCluster",
    cluster_name=cluster_config.cluster_name,
    version=eks.KubernetesVersion.V1_35,
    vpc=self.vpc,
    compute=eks.ComputeConfig(node_pools=["system", "general-purpose"]),
    endpoint_access=eks.EndpointAccess.PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE,
    role=cluster_admin_role,
    vpc_subnets=[ec2.SubnetSelection(subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS)],
    logging=eks.ClusterLoggingTypes.all(),  # Enable all logging
)
```

### Add CloudWatch Container Insights

```bash
# Apply Container Insights DaemonSet
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/latest/k8s-deployment-manifest-templates/deployment-mode/daemonset/container-insights-monitoring/quickstart/cwagent-fluentd-quickstart.yaml
```

### Load Balancer Configuration

GCO installs the AWS Load Balancer Controller with Gateway API support and intentionally creates one internal ALB from the `gco-system/gco-gateway` Gateway (see `lambda/kubectl-applier-simple/manifests/post-helm-gateway.yaml`). If you add another operator-owned Gateway, keep its exposure explicit and do not create endpoint-specific inference routes that bypass the authenticated proxy:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.k8s.aws/v1
kind: LoadBalancerConfiguration
metadata:
  name: my-gateway-load-balancer
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  scheme: internal
```

### Add Prometheus Monitoring

```bash
# Install Prometheus using Helm
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring \
  --create-namespace
```

## Cost Tracking Setup

GCO includes built-in cost visibility via the `gco costs` CLI commands. These use AWS Cost Explorer to show spend filtered by the `Project: GCO` tag that CDK applies to all resources.

### Activating Cost Allocation Tags

Cost Explorer requires tags to be explicitly activated before they can be used for filtering. This is a one-time setup per AWS account. The CLI handles it:

```bash
gco costs allocation status                        # check activation state
gco costs allocation activate                      # Project + aws:eks:cluster-name
gco costs allocation activate -t Environment -t Owner  # extra keys
```

Or activate manually in the console:

1. Open the [AWS Billing Console → Cost Allocation Tags](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/tags)
2. Under "User-defined cost allocation tags", search for `Project`
3. Select the `Project` tag and click "Activate"
4. Optionally also activate `Environment` and `Owner` for more granular filtering
5. Wait ~24 hours for the tag data to appear in Cost Explorer

In an AWS Organization, activation (CLI or console) requires the management (payer) account. See [COST_MONITORING.md — Billing-side attribution](COST_MONITORING.md#billing-side-attribution-tags-and-the-cur) for the AWS-generated `aws:eks:cluster-name` tag and split cost allocation data.

### Verifying Cost Tracking

After activation, verify with:

```bash
# Should show costs filtered by Project:GCO tag
gco costs summary

# If tags haven't propagated yet, use --all for total account costs
gco costs summary --all
```

### Available Cost Commands

```bash
gco costs summary              # Spend by AWS service
gco costs regions              # Spend by region
gco costs trend --days 14      # Daily cost trend with chart
gco costs workloads            # Real-time running workload estimates
gco costs forecast             # 30-day cost forecast
```

See [CLI Reference](CLI.md#costs-commands) for full details.

### Configure Cost Monitoring (OpenCost + Athena)

Separate from Cost Explorer billing data, the cost monitoring pipeline (on by
default) allocates Kubernetes cost per namespace with [OpenCost](https://opencost.io/), writes
scheduled [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/) reports to a central S3 bucket, and exposes cross-region
[Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/what-is.html) analytics plus the spot price gate on the central queue. Tune it under
`cost_monitoring` in `cdk.json`:

```json
"cost_monitoring": {
  "enabled": true,
  "reports": {
    "interval_minutes": 60,
    "retention_days": 365,
    "transition_to_infrequent_access_days": 90
  },
  "athena": {
    "query_results_retention_days": 30
  }
}
```

- `enabled` — master toggle. Requires `cluster_observability.enabled`
  (OpenCost reads the in-cluster Prometheus); disabling observability turns
  the cost pipeline off with it.
- `reports.interval_minutes` — scheduled report cadence (5-1440).
- `reports.retention_days` / `reports.transition_to_infrequent_access_days` —
  S3 lifecycle for report objects (transition must be smaller than retention;
  validated at synth).
- `athena.query_results_retention_days` — lifecycle for Athena query results.

Redeploy after changing the block (`gco stacks deploy-all`). Full guide:
[COST_MONITORING.md](COST_MONITORING.md).

```bash
gco costs k8s namespaces       # Kubernetes cost by namespace (Athena)
gco costs k8s regions          # Kubernetes cost by region (Athena)
gco costs k8s top --by cluster # Top spenders
gco costs report status        # OpenCost + report pipeline health
gco costs dashboard            # Open the Grafana cost dashboard
```

## FSx for Lustre Configuration

[FSx for Lustre](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/what-is.html) provides high-performance parallel file system storage ideal for ML training workloads that require high throughput and low latency.

### Lustre Version Compatibility

GCO uses Lustre 2.15 which is compatible with EKS Auto Mode's Bottlerocket nodes (kernel 6.x).

| Lustre Version | Kernel 5.x (AL2) | Kernel 6.x (AL2023/Bottlerocket) |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| 2.10           | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No                            |
| 2.12           | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes                           |
| 2.15           | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes                           |

See [AWS Lustre Client Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/lustre-client-matrix.html) for details.

### Enable FSx

```bash
# Enable FSx for Lustre
gco stacks fsx enable -y

# Redeploy the stack
gco stacks deploy gco-us-east-1 -y
```

### Configure FSx Storage

Edit `cdk.json` to customize FSx storage settings:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "fsx_lustre": {
      "enabled": true,
      "storage_capacity_gib": 1200,
      "deployment_type": "SCRATCH_2",
      "file_system_type_version": "2.15",
      "data_compression_type": "LZ4",
      "per_unit_storage_throughput": 200
    }
  }
}
```

**Deployment Types:**

- `SCRATCH_1`: Temporary storage, no replication (cheapest)
- `SCRATCH_2`: Temporary storage with better burst performance (recommended for most workloads)
- `PERSISTENT_1`: Persistent storage with data replication
- `PERSISTENT_2`: Latest persistent storage with higher throughput

**File System Type Version:**

- `2.15`: Latest version, recommended (default)
- `2.12`: Compatible with kernel 6.x

**Storage Capacity:**

- Minimum: 1200 GiB for SCRATCH_2
- Must be in increments of 2400 GiB for SCRATCH_2

### Using FSx in Jobs

Jobs can mount FSx storage using the pre-created PVC:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: fsx-training-job
  namespace: gco-jobs
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: training
        image: your-training-image
        volumeMounts:
        - name: fsx-scratch
          mountPath: /scratch
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "4"
            memory: "16Gi"
      
      volumes:
      - name: fsx-scratch
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: gco-fsx-storage
      
      restartPolicy: Never
```

**Available PVCs:**

- `gco-fsx-storage` in `default` namespace
- `gco-fsx-storage` in `gco-jobs` namespace
- `gco-fsx-storage` in `gco-system` namespace

See `examples/fsx-lustre-job.yaml` for a complete example.

### Configure Valkey Cache

GCO can deploy an ElastiCache Serverless Valkey cache in each regional stack for low-latency key-value storage. Use cases include prompt caching for inference, session state, feature stores, and shared state across pods.

Enable via CLI:

```bash
# Enable Valkey
gco stacks valkey enable -y

# Enable with custom settings
gco stacks valkey enable --max-storage 10 --max-ecpu 10000 -y

# Check current status
gco stacks valkey status

# Disable
gco stacks valkey disable -y

# Redeploy to apply
gco stacks deploy-all -y
```

Or edit `cdk.json` directly:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "valkey": {
      "enabled": true,
      "max_data_storage_gb": 5,
      "max_ecpu_per_second": 5000,
      "snapshot_retention_limit": 1
    }
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable/disable Valkey cache |
| `max_data_storage_gb` | 5 | Maximum data storage in GB (auto-scales from 1 GB) |
| `max_ecpu_per_second` | 5000 | Maximum ElastiCache Processing Units per second |
| `snapshot_retention_limit` | 1 | Number of daily snapshots to retain |

After enabling, redeploy the regional stack:

```bash
gco stacks deploy gco-us-east-1 -y
```

### Using Valkey in Jobs

When Valkey is enabled, GCO creates a `gco-valkey` ConfigMap in each namespace with the endpoint and port. Reference it in your pod spec — no need to look up or hardcode endpoint URLs:

```yaml
env:
- name: VALKEY_ENDPOINT
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: gco-valkey
      key: endpoint
- name: VALKEY_PORT
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: gco-valkey
      key: port
```

The same manifest works in any region — the ConfigMap resolves to the local Valkey endpoint automatically.

For use outside the cluster (scripts, Lambda functions), the endpoint is also stored in SSM at `/{project}/valkey-endpoint-{region}`.

See `examples/valkey-cache-job.yaml` for a complete working example.

### Configure Aurora pgvector

GCO can deploy an Aurora Serverless v2 PostgreSQL cluster with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension in each regional stack for vector similarity search. Use cases include RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), semantic search, embedding storage, and similarity queries for AI/ML workloads.

Aurora Serverless v2 supports scaling to 0 ACU — the cluster automatically pauses after a period of inactivity and resumes in ~15 seconds on the first connection. You pay only for storage while paused. This is ideal for dev/test environments and workloads that can tolerate a brief cold start.

Enable via CLI:

```bash
# Enable Aurora pgvector
gco stacks aurora enable -y

# Enable with custom settings
gco stacks aurora enable --min-acu 2 --max-acu 32 --deletion-protection -y

# Check current status
gco stacks aurora status

# Disable
gco stacks aurora disable -y

# Redeploy to apply
gco stacks deploy-all -y
```

Or edit `cdk.json` directly:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "aurora_pgvector": {
      "enabled": true,
      "min_acu": 0,
      "max_acu": 16,
      "backup_retention_days": 7,
      "deletion_protection": false
    }
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable/disable Aurora pgvector |
| `min_acu` | 0 | Minimum Aurora Capacity Units (0 = scale to zero / auto-pause) |
| `max_acu` | 16 | Maximum Aurora Capacity Units |
| `backup_retention_days` | 7 | Number of days to retain automated backups |
| `deletion_protection` | `false` | Enable deletion protection (recommended for production) |

Set `min_acu` to `0.5` or higher to disable auto-pause and keep the cluster always warm.

After enabling, redeploy the regional stack:

```bash
gco stacks deploy gco-us-east-1 -y
```

### Using Aurora pgvector in Jobs

When Aurora pgvector is enabled, GCO creates a `gco-aurora-pgvector` ConfigMap in each namespace with the endpoint, port, secret ARN, and database name. Reference it in your pod spec:

```yaml
env:
- name: AURORA_ENDPOINT
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: gco-aurora-pgvector
      key: endpoint
- name: AURORA_PORT
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: gco-aurora-pgvector
      key: port
- name: AURORA_SECRET_ARN
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: gco-aurora-pgvector
      key: secret_arn
- name: AURORA_DATABASE
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: gco-aurora-pgvector
      key: database
```

Credentials are stored in AWS [Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html). Pods retrieve them using the ServiceAccountRole's [IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) permissions — no static credentials needed. The same manifest works in any region because the ConfigMap resolves to the local Aurora endpoint automatically.

The cluster includes both a writer and a reader instance for high availability. The reader auto-scales with the writer. Use the `reader_endpoint` for read-heavy workloads (similarity searches, embedding lookups) and the `endpoint` for writes (inserts, DDL).

For use outside the cluster (scripts, Lambda functions), the endpoint is also stored in SSM at `/{project}/aurora-pgvector-endpoint-{region}`.

See `examples/aurora-pgvector-job.yaml` for a complete working example that creates the pgvector extension, an embeddings table with an HNSW index, and runs a similarity search.

## Configure the Vector Store

GCO can provision a **globally replicated vector store**: a
`{project}-vector-store` [DynamoDB global table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html)
with a native vector index over an S3-ingested document corpus. Drop
`.txt`/`.md`/`.jsonl` files under the corpus prefix of the always-on
cluster-shared bucket (or run `gco vector ingest`), and an S3-triggered
Lambda chunks each document, embeds it with the configured
[Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html)
text-embedding model, and writes the vectors once — global-table
replication then fans the corpus (and its index) out to every deployment
region, so workloads and `gco vector search` read from their own region.

The feature is **off by default** and enabled in `cdk.json`:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "vector_store": {
      "enabled": true,
      "dimensions": 1024,
      "distance_function": "COSINE",
      "embedding_model_id": "amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0",
      "replica_regions": [],
      "corpus_prefix": "vector-corpus/"
    }
  }
}
```

Then deploy the global stack (`gco stacks deploy gco-global -y`) and the
regional stacks (`gco stacks deploy-all -y`) to roll out the ConfigMaps and
workload IAM grants. After the first enabled deploy the vector index takes
several minutes to build; `gco vector status` shows where things stand, and
searches answer a "still building" hint until it is ACTIVE.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Provision the table, index, ingest pipeline, and regional wiring |
| `dimensions` | `1024` | Embedding width. **One-way door**: immutable after index creation and must match the embedding model's output width |
| `distance_function` | `COSINE` | Similarity metric (`COSINE` or `EUCLIDEAN`); immutable after index creation |
| `embedding_model_id` | `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` | Bedrock embedding model for ingest and queries. Deliberately independent of mission memory's `bedrock.embedding_model_id` |
| `replica_regions` | `[]` | Regions to replicate into. Empty means "follow `deployment_regions.regional`", minus the global region (the primary) |
| `corpus_prefix` | `vector-corpus/` | S3 key prefix on the cluster-shared bucket watched by the ingest Lambda |

Cost model: the table is on-demand, so a mostly idle corpus costs storage
plus per-request reads — but **every write is replicated**, so ingesting a
corpus pays one write per chunk per region (plus one Bedrock embedding call
per chunk, paid once). Storage is billed per region. Adding
`replica_regions` multiplies the write and storage sides accordingly; the
read side is what you are buying — local-latency similarity search with no
per-region infrastructure to run.

### Vector store or Aurora pgvector?

GCO ships two vector-search options because they sit at opposite ends of
the operational spectrum:

| | Vector store (`vector_store`) | Aurora pgvector (`aurora_pgvector`) |
|---|---|---|
| Data model | Document corpus: chunks + vectors, one index, similarity + inline source filter | Full PostgreSQL: SQL, joins, HNSW/IVF indexes, transactions, any schema |
| Scope | One global table, replicated to every deployment region | One cluster per regional stack, VPC-local |
| Ingestion | Managed: S3 drop → Lambda chunks/embeds/writes | Yours: jobs create tables, embed, and insert |
| Access | IAM only (DynamoDB + Bedrock APIs), from pods, the CLI, or anything with credentials | In-VPC network access + Secrets Manager credentials |
| Idle cost | Storage + on-demand requests (serverless) | Aurora Serverless v2 ACU floor per region |
| Fits | Shared reference corpus (runbooks, docs, procedures) read everywhere | Workload-owned embeddings with relational needs and heavy in-region write traffic |

Rule of thumb: if the question is "let every region search these
documents", use the vector store; if it is "my workload needs a real
database that also does vectors", use Aurora pgvector.

### Using the Vector Store in Jobs

When enabled, GCO creates a `gco-vector-store` ConfigMap in each workload
namespace carrying the table name, index name, embedding-model contract,
and the cluster's own region (pods query their local replica):

```yaml
env:
- name: VECTOR_TABLE
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: gco-vector-store
      key: table_name
- name: VECTOR_INDEX
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: gco-vector-store
      key: index_name
- name: VECTOR_EMBEDDING_MODEL
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: gco-vector-store
      key: embedding_model_id
- name: VECTOR_REGION
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: gco-vector-store
      key: region
```

The shared workload role carries read-only grants (`dynamodb:SearchVectors`,
`GetItem`, `Query` on the local replica, plus `bedrock:InvokeModel` on the
embedding model so pods can embed their own query text). Writes belong
exclusively to the ingest Lambda — a compromised workload cannot poison the
corpus. Query vectors must come from the ConfigMap's `embedding_model_id`
at the ConfigMap's `dimensions`; vectors from any other model or width are
not comparable to the stored corpus.

For use outside the cluster, the names are also in SSM at
`/{project}/vector-store-table-name` and
`/{project}/vector-store-index-name` (global region), and `gco vector
search` wraps the whole path.

### Corpus lifecycle and limits

- **Re-uploading a document overwrites its chunks in place** — chunk ids
  are deterministic, so S3's at-least-once event delivery and repeated
  ingests are safe.
- **Deleting an S3 object does not delete its items.** The store is
  additive; remove stale content by re-creating the corpus (empty the
  prefix, re-upload, re-ingest) or by deleting items directly.
- **A shrinking document leaves tail chunks behind** until the corpus is
  re-ingested.
- **Embedding-model drift means re-ingesting.** Vectors are only
  comparable to vectors from the model that wrote them; every item records
  its `embedding_model_id` for exactly this audit. The monthly dependency
  scan tracks `vector_store.embedding_model_id` and repeats this caveat
  when it flags a newer same-family model.
- `dimensions` and `distance_function` are immutable after index creation;
  changing either means destroying and re-creating the store (and
  re-ingesting).

## Infrastructure Version Constants

All pinned infrastructure versions — EKS add-on versions, Lambda runtime, Aurora PostgreSQL engine version — are centralised in `gco/stacks/constants.py`. This is the single source of truth for version-pinned components.

When updating a version:

1. Edit the constant in `gco/stacks/constants.py`
2. Run `pytest tests/test_regional_stack.py` to verify synthesis
3. Run `pytest tests/test_nag_compliance.py` to verify compliance
4. Redeploy with `gco stacks deploy-all -y`

The monthly `deps-scan` workflow (`.github/scripts/dependency-scan.sh`) checks these constants against the latest available versions and opens a GitHub issue when updates are available.

## Bedrock Model Selection

GCO uses an Amazon Bedrock model for three optional, **advisory** features:

- **Mission sampling** — the goal-directed Mission engine can ask a model for strategy-revision rationales and final-report lessons (`gco mission ...`).
- **Capacity advisor** — `gco capacity ai-recommend` and `gco capacity predict` send capacity data to a model for a placement/timing recommendation, and the `ai_recommend` MCP tool does the same.
- **Mission memory embedding** — [mission memory](MISSION.md#mission-memory) embeds directives with a separate text-embedding model (`context.bedrock.embedding_model_id`, stock value `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`) to write and query the mission-memory vector index.

Both default to **Anthropic Claude Opus 5** through its system-defined global
cross-Region inference profile (`global.anthropic.claude-opus-5`). It is the
default because:

- The global profile maximizes throughput by allowing Bedrock to route across
  supported worldwide Regions. Choose a geography-scoped profile instead when
  your workload has data-residency constraints.
- It is Anthropic's most capable Opus model for long-running agentic work,
  which is what both features ask of it — placement reasoning over live
  capacity data, and Mission strategy revision.
- The stock `cdk.json` configuration runs Claude
  [adaptive thinking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/claude-messages-adaptive-thinking.html)
  at `high` effort, its default level, where Claude decides per request how
  much to think. GCO translates that setting to Converse `thinking` +
  `output_config` fields and skips the leading `reasoningContent` block when
  reading the final answer.

> **One-time setup:** Anthropic models require a **first-time-use (FTU) case
> form** per AWS account before the first invocation. See
> [Accepting the Anthropic first-time-use form](#accepting-the-anthropic-first-time-use-form)
> below — this is a prerequisite for the stock default.
>
> **Cost and latency:** reasoning tokens are billed as output tokens. High

> These Bedrock features are advisory and degrade gracefully. When no model is reachable (no credentials, model not enabled, or access denied) the Mission engine falls back to its deterministic templates and the capacity advisor surfaces a clear error. Core orchestration never depends on Bedrock. The one exception is the Anthropic FTU form: because it is a permanent account-setup gap rather than a transient fault, it is reported as an error instead of being absorbed by a fallback.

### Accepting the Anthropic first-time-use form

Anthropic asks every AWS account (or organization) to submit a one-time
**use case details** form before it may invoke any Anthropic model, including
the stock default. It is required **once per account or organization** across
all commercial Regions — opt-in Regions require it again — and it does not
apply to Anthropic models reached through the `bedrock-mantle` endpoint. Until
it is submitted, Bedrock rejects every Anthropic invocation with error code
[`FTUFormNotFilled`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-api-error-codes.html)
(HTTP 404).

GCO treats that specific code as a **hard error, never a silent fallback**.
Every other Bedrock failure is potentially transient, so the advisory features
degrade gracefully; a missing FTU form is a permanent, account-scoped
misconfiguration that would fail identically on every retry, so degrading
quietly would hide a one-line fix. Instead:

- `gco capacity ai-recommend` and `gco capacity predict` print the remediation
  and exit non-zero.
- `gco mission scaffold-criteria --use-sampling` reports it rather than
  scaffolding deterministic criteria.
- A Mission run fails on the iteration that first samples, rather than
  completing on deterministic templates as though sampling had been optional.
- `scripts/capture_scaffold_fixtures.py` stops on the first occurrence instead
  of repeating the same failure for every Anthropic model.

**Option 1 — console (usual route).** In the
[Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/), open
**Model access**, request access to the Anthropic model, and complete the use
case details form.

**Option 2 — CLI/API (for automation).** Submit the form with
[`PutUseCaseForModelAccess`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_PutUseCaseForModelAccess.html).
The CLI takes the same JSON, base64-encoded, and needs AWS CLI v2.27.42 or
later:

```bash
aws bedrock put-use-case-for-model-access \
  --form-data "$(printf '%s' '{
    "companyName": "Example Corp",
    "companyWebsite": "https://example.com",
    "intendedUsers": "0",
    "industryOption": "Software",
    "otherIndustryOption": "",
    "useCases": "Internal GPU capacity placement advice and agent evaluation."
  }' | base64)"
```

`intendedUsers` is `0` (internal), `1` (external), or `2` (both). Confirm
access afterwards — `AVAILABLE` means the model is usable:

```bash
aws bedrock get-foundation-model-availability --model-id anthropic.claude-opus-5
```

The full field reference (including length limits) is in the AWS guide on
[model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html).

**Prefer to skip the form entirely?** Point GCO at a first-party Amazon model,
which needs no FTU form, using any of the override paths below — for example
`--model global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`, or by changing
`context.bedrock.mission_default_model_id` and
`context.bedrock.capacity_advisor_default_model_id` in `cdk.json`. GCO keeps
the Nova `reasoningConfig` translation, so those defaults remain fully
supported.

### Choosing a different model

You may need a specific model for **regulatory, data-residency, model-governance, or cost** reasons — for example an approved-model allowlist, a mandated Region, or a required provider. You can override the default without changing code, at three levels (highest precedence first):

**1. Per command (CLI / MCP)**

```bash
# Capacity advisor — pass any model or inference-profile id enabled in your account
gco capacity ai-recommend -w "Fine-tune a 13B model" --model us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0
gco capacity predict -i p5.48xlarge -r us-east-1 --model eu.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0

# Mission engine
gco mission start "..." --bedrock-model-id us.meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0
```

The `ai_recommend` MCP tool takes the same override as a `model="..."` argument; omit it to use the default.

**2. Per environment (env vars)** — the first two apply to Mission; the
remaining controls select an Autopilot engine/model for one environment:

```bash
export GCO_MISSION_BEDROCK_MODEL_ID="us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0"
export GCO_MISSION_BEDROCK_REGION="eu-west-1"   # default: us-east-1
export GCO_AUTOPILOT_MODEL="us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6"   # shared/Claude model
export GCO_AUTOPILOT_ENGINE="codex"
export GCO_AUTOPILOT_CODEX_MODEL="global.openai.gpt-5.6-sol"  # Codex-specific
```

**3. Change the defaults for everyone** — from a writable checkout, use the managed-config commands for every generation/session default:

```bash
gco stacks bedrock set-mission-model global.anthropic.claude-opus-5 -y
gco stacks bedrock set-capacity-advisor-model global.anthropic.claude-opus-5 -y
gco stacks bedrock set-claude-code-model us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6 -y
gco stacks bedrock set-codex-model global.openai.gpt-5.6-sol -y
gco stacks bedrock set-codex-reasoning-effort xhigh -y
```

| File | Keys |
|------|------|
| `cdk.json` | `context.bedrock.mission_default_model_id` (Mission sampling) and `context.bedrock.capacity_advisor_default_model_id` (capacity advisor), sharing `context.bedrock.generation_reasoning.effort` |
| `cdk.json` | `context.bedrock.claude_code_default_model_id` (the model `gco autopilot` hands to Claude Code) |
| `cdk.json` | `context.bedrock.codex_default_model_id` and `context.bedrock.codex.reasoning_effort` (the reviewed Codex model/effort pair) |
| `cdk.json` | `context.bedrock.embedding_model_id` (the text-embedding model [mission memory](MISSION.md#mission-memory) uses for its vector index) |

Each consumer has its own key, deliberately independent, so repointing one
feature never silently repoints another. The five managed setters above are
validated, atomic, idempotent, and audited; each changes only its target leaf
and preserves every sibling. In particular, the Codex model and reasoning
effort are separate managed edits so neither replaces the other—review the pair
together when changing model families. An explicit Codex model override bypasses
the canonical pair and omits its effort. Edit `generation_reasoning` and the
one-way-door embedding key directly only when changing those broader contracts.
The pre-v6 single `default_model_id` key fails validation with rename
instructions instead of being silently ignored. The same `cdk.json` is shipped
as package data so installed CLI and MCP entry points retain the defaults outside
a source checkout; managed writes intentionally require a writable checkout or
an explicit writable `--config-path`.

The embedding key carries a **one-way-door coupling**: the mission-memory
vector index is created with `mission_memory.dimensions` (default 1024,
matching Titan Text Embeddings V2's default width), that width is immutable
after index creation, and query vectors must come from the same model at the
same width or similarity results are meaningless. Changing the embedding
model therefore means recreating the index and re-embedding stored items
(`gco mission memory backfill`) — think once before repointing it.
`tests/test_default_bedrock_model_consistency.py` guards the resolver,
per-consumer accessors, package-data declaration, inference-profile shape,
reasoning translation, and captured fixture.

The canonical generation-reasoning setting applies only when the selected model id is one
of the configured generation defaults, and it is translated into whichever reasoning dialect
that model speaks — Claude adaptive `thinking` + `output_config` for Opus 4.6+,
Sonnet 4.6, and the Mythos/Fable lines, or Nova 2 `reasoningConfig` for Nova 2
profiles. A per-call or environment override, or a default in neither dialect
(including pre-4.6 Claude models, which require the legacy
`thinking.type: "enabled"` form), keeps that caller's normal inference controls
and receives no reasoning fields.

Resolution order (Mission sampling): `--bedrock-model-id` flag → `GCO_MISSION_BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` → `cdk.json` `context.bedrock.mission_default_model_id`. Resolution order (capacity advisor): `--model` flag / MCP `model=` → `cdk.json` `context.bedrock.capacity_advisor_default_model_id`.

Resolution order (Claude Code Autopilot): `--model` / `-m` →
`GCO_AUTOPILOT_MODEL` → `context.bedrock.claude_code_default_model_id`.
Resolution order (Codex Autopilot): `--model` / `-m` →
`GCO_AUTOPILOT_CODEX_MODEL` → `GCO_AUTOPILOT_MODEL` →
`context.bedrock.codex_default_model_id`; the canonical
`context.bedrock.codex.reasoning_effort` is omitted whenever a model override
wins. See [Autopilot → Choosing a Model](AUTOPILOT.md#choosing-a-model-and-reasoning).

### What to check when choosing a model

- **Access** — the model (or its cross-Region inference profile) must be enabled in your account and reachable from the configured Region. Third-party models may require AWS Marketplace subscription permissions and, for Anthropic, the [FTU form](#accepting-the-anthropic-first-time-use-form). See the AWS guide on [model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html).
- **Reasoning dialect** — GCO translates `context.bedrock.generation_reasoning.effort` for Claude adaptive-thinking models and Nova 2 profiles. Another family still works; it simply receives no reasoning fields, so set an effort the model actually supports or accept its default.
- **Inference profile vs base id** — GCO pins a system-defined **global
  inference profile** id (`global.`) for maximum throughput. Global profiles
  may route worldwide; use a geography-scoped profile (`us.`, `eu.`, `jp.`,
  etc.) where a residency boundary is required. Prefer a profile id over a
  bare model id where one exists.
- **Converse API support** — GCO calls the Bedrock **Converse** API, so the model must support it (the defaults and every entry in the curated set in `scripts/capture_scaffold_fixtures.py` do).

### Staying current

The monthly **deps-scan** workflow compares the pinned default against the
newest system-defined inference profile in the *same scope and model family*
(for example, a newer global Anthropic Claude Opus release) and opens a GitHub
issue when one is available. It will not cross-suggest a geographic profile, another
tier, or another provider. It uses read-only Bedrock list permissions on the CI
OIDC role; see [CI documentation](../.github/CI.md#dependency-scan-script) and
`.github/scripts/dependency-scan.sh`.

## CDK-nag Compliance

GCO runs five [cdk-nag](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag) v3 rule packs through CDK's policy-validation framework. These are automated infrastructure checks, not certifications; passing them does not by itself establish regulatory compliance.

### Enabled Frameworks

The following rule packs are returned by `nag_validation_plugins()` in `gco/stacks/nag_suppressions.py` and registered in `app.py` with `cdk.Validations.of(app).add_plugins(...)`:

| Rule pack | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| AWS Solutions | AWS architecture best practices |
| HIPAA Security | Findings mapped to HIPAA Security Rule controls |
| NIST 800-53 Rev 5 | Findings mapped to NIST controls |
| PCI DSS 3.2.1 | Findings mapped to PCI DSS controls |
| Serverless | Serverless architecture best practices |

### Customizing Suppressions

Finding acknowledgments are centralized in `gco/stacks/nag_suppressions.py`. The removed cdk-nag v2 `NagSuppressions` and `NagPackSuppression` APIs are not available. GCO uses `acknowledge_nag_findings()`, which records cdk-nag v3 acknowledgment metadata on the narrowest relevant construct.

Each acknowledgment must include a rule ID and a specific justification. Array-style findings such as `AwsSolutions-IAM5[Resource::*]` also require every exact finding detail in `appliesTo`; cdk-nag v3 does not apply regex or bare-ID fallback matching to those details.

### Adding New Suppressions

Place the acknowledgment next to the construct that owns the intentional finding, or add a focused helper in `nag_suppressions.py`:

```python
from gco.stacks.nag_suppressions import acknowledge_nag_findings

acknowledge_nag_findings(
    my_role,
    [
        {
            "id": "AwsSolutions-IAM5",
            "reason": (
                "The service's read-only Describe API does not support "
                "resource-level permissions; this role uses it only for ..."
            ),
            "appliesTo": ["Resource::*"],
        }
    ],
)
```

Scope acknowledgments to the resource or role whenever possible. An acknowledgment on a stack applies to all descendants and can hide unrelated findings.

### Disabling Compliance Checks

Disabling rule packs weakens the policy-validation gate and is not recommended. If a deployment intentionally excludes one, edit the list returned by `nag_validation_plugins()` rather than using the removed `cdk.Aspects` registration pattern:

```python
def nag_validation_plugins(scope, *, verbose=True):
    return [
        AwsSolutionsChecks(scope, verbose=verbose),
        HIPAASecurityChecks(scope, verbose=verbose),
        NIST80053R5Checks(scope, verbose=verbose),
        PCIDSS321Checks(scope, verbose=verbose),
        # ServerlessChecks(scope, verbose=verbose),  # intentionally excluded
    ]
```

`app.py` should continue registering the resulting plugins with:

```python
cdk.Validations.of(app).add_plugins(*nag_validation_plugins(app, verbose=True))
```

## Configuration Best Practices

### 1. Use Configuration Files

Store configuration in `cdk.json` context:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "project_name": "gco",
    "deployment_regions": {
      "global": "us-east-2",
      "api_gateway": "us-east-2",
      "monitoring": "us-east-2",
      "regional": ["us-east-1"]
    },
    "enable_monitoring": true,
    "enable_gpu": true,
    "gpu_instance_families": ["g5", "g4dn"],
    "max_gpu_nodes": 10
  }
}
```

### 2. Environment-Specific Configuration

```python
# In your stack
env = self.node.try_get_context("environment") or "dev"

if env == "prod":
    replicas = 5
    instance_types = ["g5.2xlarge"]
else:
    replicas = 2
    instance_types = ["g4dn.xlarge"]
```

### 3. Version Control

- Commit all configuration changes
- Tag releases
- Use feature branches for major changes

### 4. Test in Development First

```bash
# Deploy to dev account
export AWS_PROFILE=dev
gco stacks deploy-all -y

# Test thoroughly
kubectl apply -f test-workload.yaml

# Then deploy to prod
export AWS_PROFILE=prod
gco stacks deploy-all -y
```

## EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter) Configuration

EFA enables high-performance inter-node communication for distributed training and high-performance LLM inference. GCO installs the EFA device plugin by default, and creates an EFA-optimized nodepool for instances like `p4d.24xlarge`, `p5.48xlarge`, and `p6` (B200/B300). On EKS Auto Mode the GPU AMI already ships the EFA and NVIDIA kernel drivers, so no separate networking operator is required.

### Disable EFA

EFA is enabled by default. To disable it, edit the `helm` section in `cdk.json`:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "helm": {
      "aws_efa_device_plugin": { "enabled": false }
    }
  }
}
```

Then redeploy:

```bash
gco stacks deploy-all -y
```

When enabled, this provides:

- AWS EFA Kubernetes Device Plugin (advertises `vpc.amazonaws.com/efa` resources)
- EFA-optimized nodepool (`gpu-efa-pool`) for distributed training on p4d/p5/p6 instances
- Dedicated Mooncake EFA nodepool (`mooncake-efa-pool`) for disaggregated/store
  inference. It is curated to GPUs with >=80GB of memory and FP8 support
  (p5/p5e/p5en, p6-b200/p6-b300/p6e-gb200) and deliberately excludes the
  A100-40GB `p4d` family, which OOMs on many models and cannot run FP8 KV-cache
  configs. Mooncake role pods select its `mooncake-efa=true` label automatically,
  so they never land on `p4d`. See [docs/INFERENCE.md](INFERENCE.md).

### Mooncake Protocol and Device Selection

Mooncake has two related transport settings that use different vocabularies:

- The endpoint spec and mounted `mooncake.json` use `protocol: rdma|tcp`, as
  required by the Mooncake store configuration.
- [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/)'s point-to-point `MooncakeConnector` separately reads
  `kv_connector_extra_config.mooncake_protocol`. On AWS, GCO translates the
  default `rdma` intent to `mooncake_protocol: efa` and pins the pod to the
  dedicated EFA nodepool. This avoids silently using vLLM's generic `rdma`
  default on an EFA deployment.

| CLI selection | Point-to-point connector | Pod placement |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Omitted (default) or `--mooncake-protocol rdma` | `mooncake_protocol: efa` | Dedicated `mooncake-efa-pool`; requests an EFA device |
| `--mooncake-protocol tcp` | `mooncake_protocol: tcp` | No EFA selector, toleration, or device request |

Use `--mooncake-device-name` only when the Mooncake/libfabric runtime must bind
to a specific provider-visible interface. GCO forwards the value to both the
vLLM connector and `mooncake.json`; when omitted (or explicitly empty),
Mooncake auto-detects the device. Device names are image and instance dependent,
so do not assume that a host interface name is valid inside the pod.

```bash
gco inference deploy my-llm \
  --mooncake-mode disaggregated \
  --mooncake-protocol rdma \
  --mooncake-device-name <DEVICE_NAME>

# Portable fallback when EFA is unavailable
gco inference deploy my-llm \
  --mooncake-mode disaggregated \
  --mooncake-protocol tcp
```

Both override flags require `--mooncake-mode`. The default EFA path also
requires `helm.aws_efa_device_plugin.enabled = true`; select TCP if the target
cluster intentionally has no EFA device plugin. See vLLM's
[MooncakeConnector API](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/api/vllm/distributed/kv_transfer/kv_connector/v1/mooncake/mooncake_connector/)
and [Mooncake store configuration](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/features/mooncake_store_connector_usage/)
for the two upstream configuration surfaces.

### Using EFA in Jobs

Request EFA devices in your pod spec:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    nvidia.com/gpu: "8"
    vpc.amazonaws.com/efa: "4"
  limits:
    nvidia.com/gpu: "8"
    vpc.amazonaws.com/efa: "4"
```

Set environment variables for NCCL to use EFA:

```yaml
env:
- name: FI_PROVIDER
  value: "efa"
- name: NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME
  value: "eth0"
- name: FI_EFA_USE_DEVICE_RDMA
  value: "1"
```

See `examples/efa-distributed-training.yaml` for a complete example.

### Supported Instance Types

| Instance Type | EFA Networking | GPUs (Total GPU Memory) | Use Case |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|----------|
| `p4d.24xlarge` | 400 Gbps (4x EFA) | 8x A100 (320 GB HBM2e) | Distributed training, fine-tuning |
| `p4de.24xlarge` | 400 Gbps (4x EFA) | 8x A100 (640 GB HBM2e) | Distributed training, fine-tuning |
| `p5.48xlarge` | 3,200 Gbps (32x EFA) | 8x H100 (640 GB HBM3) | Large-scale training, high-performance inference |
| `p5e.48xlarge` | 3,200 Gbps (32x EFA) | 8x H200 (1,128 GB HBM3e) | Large-scale training, high-performance inference |
| `p5en.48xlarge` | 3,200 Gbps (32x EFA) | 8x H200 (1,128 GB HBM3e) | Large-scale training, high-performance inference |
| `p6-b200.48xlarge` | 3.2 Tbps (8x EFAv4) | 8x B200 (1,432 GB HBM3e) | Large-scale training and inference |
| `p6-b300.48xlarge` | 6.4 Tbps EFAv4 | 8x B300 Ultra (2,144 GB HBM3e) | Large-scale training and inference |
| `p6e-gb200` | 28.8 Tbps (EFAv4 UltraServer) | GB200 NVL72 | Largest-scale training and inference |

### NIXL Support

With EFA enabled, GCO supports NVIDIA Inference Xfer Library (NIXL) for high-performance LLM inference. NIXL enables high-throughput, low-latency KV-cache transfer between nodes. It integrates with vLLM, [SGLang](https://docs.sglang.ai/), and NVIDIA Dynamo. Requires EFA installer v1.47.0+ which is included in EKS-optimized AMIs — EKS Auto Mode automatically uses these AMIs, so no manual AMI configuration is needed.

## AWS Trainium and Inferentia Configuration

GCO includes built-in support for AWS Trainium and [Inferentia](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia/) accelerators. These are purpose-built ML chips designed by AWS that use the Neuron SDK instead of CUDA. GCO installs the Neuron device plugin by default and creates a dedicated Neuron nodepool for trn1, trn1n, trn2, and inf2 instances. (Trainium3/Trn3 currently ships only as Trn3 UltraServers — reserved via EC2 Capacity Blocks rather than provisioned as standalone Karpenter nodes — so it is not part of this NodePool.)

### How It Works

- The Neuron device plugin (installed via Helm chart) advertises `aws.amazon.com/neuron` resources on Neuron-capable nodes
- The Neuron nodepool (`lambda/kubectl-applier-simple/manifests/44-nodepool-neuron.yaml`) provisions trn1, trn1n, trn2, and inf2 instances
- A `aws.amazon.com/neuron` taint prevents non-Neuron workloads from scheduling on these nodes
- Pods must explicitly tolerate the taint and request `aws.amazon.com/neuron` resources

### Supported Instance Types

| Instance Type | Neuron Devices (Chips) | NeuronCores | Accelerator Memory | Use Case |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| `inf2.xlarge` | 1 (Inferentia2) | 2 | 32 GB | Single-model inference |
| `inf2.24xlarge` | 6 (Inferentia2) | 12 | 192 GB | Multi-model inference |
| `inf2.48xlarge` | 12 (Inferentia2) | 24 | 384 GB | Large model inference |
| `trn1.2xlarge` | 1 (Trainium) | 2 | 32 GB | Small-scale training |
| `trn1.32xlarge` | 16 (Trainium) | 32 | 512 GB | Distributed training (1,600 Gbps EFA) |
| `trn2.3xlarge` | 1 (Trainium2) | 8 | 96 GB | Medium-scale training |
| `trn2.48xlarge` | 16 (Trainium2) | 128 | 1.5 TB | Large-scale training (3.2 Tbps EFA) |

### Using Neuron in Jobs

Request Neuron devices in your pod spec:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    aws.amazon.com/neuron: 1
  limits:
    aws.amazon.com/neuron: 1
tolerations:
- key: aws.amazon.com/neuron
  operator: Equal
  value: "true"
  effect: NoSchedule
```

Container images must include the Neuron runtime — use images from `public.ecr.aws/neuron/`.

See `examples/trainium-job.yaml` and `examples/inferentia-job.yaml` for complete examples.

## Troubleshooting Customizations

### Changes Not Applied

1. Rebuild Lambda package if you modified manifests
2. Force update: `gco stacks deploy-all -y`
3. Check CloudFormation events for errors

### Image Build Failures

1. Ensure Finch/Docker is running
2. Check Dockerfile syntax
3. Verify base image availability

### Manifest Application Failures

1. Resolve the generated log-group name from CloudFormation (physical names are not fixed):

   ```bash
   aws cloudformation list-stack-resources \
     --stack-name gco-REGION --region REGION \
     --query "StackResourceSummaries[?ResourceType=='AWS::Logs::LogGroup'].{Logical:LogicalResourceId,Physical:PhysicalResourceId}"
   aws logs tail <EXACT_LOG_GROUP_NAME> --region REGION --since 30m
   ```

2. Validate YAML syntax.
3. Ensure image placeholders match CDK configuration.

## Regional API Gateway (Aggregation Bridge and Direct Regional Access)

A regional API bridge is always deployed in every workload region. The
centralized aggregator is not VPC-attached and uses these reachable API Gateway
endpoints to fan out to each region. In the commercial `aws` partition,
`api_gateway.regional_api_enabled` controls whether other IAM-authorized
principals in the deployment account may invoke a bridge directly. In every
other AWS partition, Global Accelerator is omitted and same-account direct
regional access is enabled automatically as the supported workload ingress.

### Enable Direct Regional Access in the `aws` Partition

Edit `cdk.json` to admit direct same-account callers to every regional bridge.
Outside `aws`, no opt-in is needed and this setting cannot disable the required
regional ingress:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "api_gateway": {
      "regional_api_enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

Then redeploy:

```bash
gco stacks deploy-all -y
```

### How It Works

Each bridge uses an IAM-authorized API Gateway and a Lambda in the workload
VPC. The global aggregator reaches it over AWS-managed TLS with [SigV4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.html); an
opted-in user follows the same first hop:

```text
Aggregator or authorized direct user
  → Regional API Gateway (AWS-managed TLS + IAM SigV4)
  → VPC Lambda (request-bound HMAC)
  → Internal ALB (private-root TLS) → EKS pod (re-encrypted HTTPS)
```

The Lambda resolves the current ALB from
`/<project>/alb-hostname-<region>` in the global-region SSM registry and verifies
that it is this account and region's internal application ALB for the exact GCO
EKS cluster and platform Gateway. It reads the public root bundle from SSM,
connects with explicit `backend.<project>.gco.internal` SNI/hostname assertion,
and never receives the root private key. This path bypasses Global Accelerator,
not a public ALB.

### Using Regional APIs

```bash
# Use --regional-api with an explicit deployed region
gco --regional-api jobs list --region us-east-1
gco --regional-api jobs submit job.yaml --region us-east-1

# Or select regional mode for subsequent commands
export GCO_REGIONAL_API=true
gco jobs list --region us-east-1
```

**When to use:**

- A caller needs an explicitly region-pinned request path
- An operation should bypass Global Accelerator health/latency routing
- The deployment is outside the commercial `aws` partition, where regional APIs are the required workload ingress
- An organizational control requires use of the regional API endpoint

### Security Considerations

Regional APIs preserve the backend authentication model used by the global path:

- AWS-managed TLS and IAM authentication (SigV4) at API Gateway
- Exact-request HMAC signing by the VPC Lambda with a rotating key that is never forwarded
- Deployment-local private-root TLS to the ALB with explicit SNI and hostname verification
- Backend freshness, integrity, body-digest, and nonce-replay validation; HMAC is not encryption
- Runtime verification of the SSM-registered internal ALB
- Public SSM trust only; the root private key remains in the certificate-manager's KMS-encrypted secret
- No public exposure of the ALB or EKS API

## Queue Processor (SQS Consumer)

GCO ships with a built-in queue processor that automatically consumes manifests submitted via `gco jobs submit-sqs`. It uses a KEDA ScaledJob that scales consumer pods based on SQS queue depth — zero pods when the queue is empty, up to `max_concurrent_jobs` when messages are waiting.

### Configuration

Queue-processor-specific settings live in `cdk.json` under `queue_processor`. Validation policy (namespace allowlist, resource caps, image registry allowlist, security toggles) lives under `job_validation_policy` because the REST manifest processor reads the same values — see [Security Policy Configuration](#security-policy-configuration) for that section.

```json
"queue_processor": {
  "enabled": true,
  "polling_interval": 10,
  "max_concurrent_jobs": 10,
  "messages_per_job": 1,
  "successful_jobs_history": 20,
  "failed_jobs_history": 10
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Set to `false` to disable the built-in consumer entirely |
| `polling_interval` | `10` | How often KEDA checks the SQS queue for new messages (seconds) |
| `max_concurrent_jobs` | `10` | Maximum consumer pods running in parallel |
| `messages_per_job` | `1` | KEDA target queue messages per active consumer Job (`queueLength`); each built-in worker still receives one message |
| `successful_jobs_history` | `20` | How many completed consumer jobs to keep in history |
| `failed_jobs_history` | `10` | How many failed consumer jobs to keep in history |

For namespace allowlisting, resource caps, and security toggles (shared between both services):

```json
"job_validation_policy": {
  "allowed_namespaces": ["gco-jobs"],
  "resource_quotas": {
    "max_cpu_per_manifest": "384",
    "max_memory_per_manifest": "4096Gi",
    "max_gpu_per_manifest": 16
  }
}
```

The caps limit what a single submitted manifest may request in total (summed
across all containers). They sit between two other enforcement layers, and
synth validates the ordering so the three always tell one story:

- `resource_quota.container_max_*` (the gco-jobs `LimitRange`) caps each
  container; a manifest cap below it would reject manifests whose single
  container the cluster admits.
- `resource_quota.max_*` (the gco-jobs `ResourceQuota`) caps the namespace
  aggregate; a manifest cap above it would accept manifests whose pods can
  never all run.

The defaults size a per-manifest budget of two full accelerator nodes
(2 × p5.48xlarge: 384 vCPUs, 16 GPUs) so the shipped distributed-training
examples pass the front door unchanged.

The per-container and namespace layers live under the top-level
`resource_quota` context (substituted into the gco-jobs `ResourceQuota` and
`LimitRange` manifests at deploy time), with defaults sized for one full
accelerator node per container and two nodes plus headroom per namespace:

```json
"resource_quota": {
  "max_cpu": "400",
  "max_memory": "4096Gi",
  "max_gpu": "32",
  "max_pods": "50",
  "container_max_cpu": "192",
  "container_max_memory": "2048Gi",
  "container_max_gpu": "8"
}
```

Overrides are validated at synth: unknown keys, unparseable quantities, a
container ceiling above its namespace ceiling, or a manifest cap outside the
`container_max_* <= *_per_manifest <= max_*` ordering all fail the deploy
with a message naming the offending pair.

### Disabling the Built-In Consumer

If you want to implement your own SQS consumer (e.g., with custom validation logic, different scaling behavior, or a different processing pipeline), set `enabled` to `false`:

```json
"queue_processor": {
  "enabled": false
}
```

Then redeploy. The post-Helm applier treats the absent queue-processor image gate as a disabled feature and deletes the exact managed `gco-system/sqs-queue-processor` ScaledJob if it exists; unrelated ScaledJobs are untouched.

The shipped `examples/keda-scaled-job.yaml` is a safe **non-consuming scaling demonstration**, not a custom consumer implementation. It uses an explicit disposable-queue placeholder, has no AWS credentials, and never receives or deletes messages. Do not point it at the GCO `JobQueueUrl`. For a real custom consumer, implement validation and processing first, and acknowledge a message only after processing succeeds. The KEDA operator will also need metric-read permission for the custom queue.

### How It Works

1. User runs `gco jobs submit-sqs manifest.yaml --region us-east-1`
2. CLI sends the manifest(s) as a JSON message to the regional SQS queue
3. KEDA detects the message and spins up a queue-processor pod
4. The pod reads the message, validates the manifest(s), and applies them via the Kubernetes API
5. On success, the message is deleted from SQS
6. On failure, the message returns to the queue after the visibility timeout (5 min) and eventually moves to the DLQ after 3 failed attempts

### Security Parity with the REST Path

The queue processor enforces the same security checks as the REST manifest processor. Both paths read the same `job_validation_policy.manifest_security_policy` section in `cdk.json`, so a single toggle flip (for example setting `block_run_as_root: true`) applies to both submission paths at the next deploy.

The checks enforced on both paths are:

- Namespace allowlist
- Resource kind allowlist (`allowed_kinds`)
- Privileged pods and containers (`block_privileged`)
- Privilege escalation (`block_privilege_escalation`)
- Host namespace access — `hostNetwork`, `hostPID`, `hostIPC`
- `hostPath` volumes (`block_host_path`)
- Added Linux capabilities (`block_added_capabilities`)
- `runAsUser: 0` (`block_run_as_root`, off by default)
- Image registry allowlist (`trusted_registries`, `trusted_dockerhub_orgs`)
- Resource caps (CPU, memory, GPU summed across all container kinds)

See [Security Policy Configuration](#security-policy-configuration) for the full reference and JSON examples.

## Cost Optimization

### Spot vs On-Demand

Spot instances can save 60-70% over on-demand for GPU workloads. GCO's nodepools support both:

```yaml
# In nodepool manifests
- key: "karpenter.sh/capacity-type"
  operator: In
  values: ["spot", "on-demand"]  # Spot preferred, on-demand fallback
```

Use spot for fault-tolerant workloads and for everything else use on-demand.

### Storage Costs

| Storage | Pricing Model | Best For | Rough Cost |
|---------|--------------|----------|------------|
| EFS | Per GB stored + throughput | General purpose, small datasets | ~$0.30/GB/month |
| FSx Lustre | Per GB provisioned | HPC, large datasets, high throughput | ~$0.14/GB/month (SCRATCH_2) |

FSx is cheaper per GB but you pay for provisioned capacity (minimum 1.2 TB). EFS scales to zero cost when empty.

### Scale-to-Zero Savings

Inference endpoints with KEDA can scale to zero when idle, eliminating GPU costs during off-hours:

```yaml
minReplicaCount: 0   # No GPU cost when idle
cooldownPeriod: 300  # Scale down after 5 min of no traffic
```

A single `g5.xlarge` (1x A10G GPU) costs ~$1.00/hour on-demand. Scale-to-zero during 12 hours of off-peak saves ~$360/month per endpoint.

### Sample Monthly Costs

These estimates cover compute costs only. Add ~$250-300/month per region for fixed infrastructure (EKS cluster fee, NAT Gateways, ALB, Global Accelerator). Storage and data transfer costs are additional.

| Deployment | Config | Compute Cost | Total (with infra) |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Small | 1 region, 2× g5.xlarge spot (2 GPUs) | ~$450-600/mo | ~$700-900/mo |
| Medium | 2 regions, 8× g5.2xlarge spot (8 GPUs), EFS + FSx | ~$2,100-2,800/mo | ~$3,000-4,000/mo |
| Large | 4 regions, 4× p4d.24xlarge spot (32 GPUs total), EFS + FSx | ~$29,000-38,000/mo | ~$31,000-40,000/mo |

Costs vary significantly by instance type, spot availability, and utilization. Use `gco costs summary` and `gco costs forecast` for actual spend tracking.
