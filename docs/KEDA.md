# KEDA Integration

GCO includes [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling) for scaling workloads based on external event sources. KEDA is enabled by default and powers GCO's built-in SQS queue processor.

## Overview

KEDA extends Kubernetes with event-driven autoscaling. It can scale Deployments, Jobs, and custom resources from zero to N based on metrics from external systems like SQS, Kafka, Prometheus, CloudWatch, and 60+ other sources.

**When to use KEDA:**

- Scale-to-zero workloads that should only run when there's work to do
- SQS-triggered job processing (GCO's built-in queue processor uses this)
- Autoscaling based on custom metrics (Prometheus, CloudWatch, Datadog)
- Event-driven architectures where workloads respond to external signals
- Cost optimization by scaling GPU workloads to zero when idle

## What Gets Deployed

KEDA is installed via Helm chart in the `keda` namespace:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| keda-operator | Watches ScaledObject/ScaledJob CRDs and manages HPA/Jobs |
| keda-metrics-apiserver | Exposes external metrics to the Kubernetes metrics API |
| keda-admission-webhooks | Validates KEDA custom resources |

The KEDA operator has an IRSA role with permissions to read SQS queue metrics for the GCO job queue.

## How GCO Uses KEDA

GCO's built-in SQS queue processor (`manifests/post-helm-sqs-consumer.yaml`) is a KEDA ScaledJob:

```text
User runs: gco jobs submit-sqs manifest.yaml --region us-east-1
  → Manifest sent to regional SQS queue
  → KEDA detects message, spins up consumer pod
  → Consumer applies manifest to cluster
  → Message deleted, pod terminates
  → KEDA scales back to zero when queue is empty
```

This is configured automatically — no user setup needed.

## Key Concepts

### ScaledObject

Scales a Deployment based on an external metric:

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: my-scaler
  namespace: gco-jobs
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: my-deployment
  minReplicaCount: 0
  maxReplicaCount: 10
  triggers:
  - type: prometheus
    metadata:
      serverAddress: http://prometheus:9090
      metricName: http_requests_total
      query: sum(rate(http_requests_total[2m]))
      threshold: '100'
```

### ScaledJob

Creates Kubernetes Jobs in response to events (scale-to-zero capable):

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledJob
metadata:
  name: sqs-processor
  namespace: gco-jobs
spec:
  jobTargetRef:
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: processor
          image: my-processor:latest
        restartPolicy: Never
  pollingInterval: 10
  maxReplicaCount: 20
  triggers:
  - type: aws-sqs-queue
    metadata:
      queueURL: "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789/my-queue"
      queueLength: "5"
      awsRegion: "us-east-1"
      identityOwner: operator
```

### Common Triggers

| Trigger | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `aws-sqs-queue` | Process messages from SQS (used by GCO queue processor) |
| `prometheus` | Scale based on Prometheus metrics |
| `aws-cloudwatch` | Scale based on CloudWatch metrics |
| `cron` | Time-based scaling (e.g., scale up during business hours) |
| `kafka` | Process Kafka topic messages |
| `cpu` / `memory` | Scale based on resource utilization |

## Run the Example

The example creates a custom SQS-triggered ScaledJob (separate from GCO's built-in consumer):

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/keda-scaled-job.yaml
kubectl get scaledjob -n gco-jobs
kubectl get pods -n gco-jobs -l app=sqs-processor
```

Note: The example uses `{{JOB_QUEUE_URL}}` and `{{REGION}}` placeholders that are replaced during stack deployment. To use it standalone, replace these with actual values.

## Scale Inference to Zero

KEDA can scale inference endpoints to zero when there's no traffic, saving GPU costs:

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: inference-scaler
  namespace: gco-inference
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: my-llm-deployment
  minReplicaCount: 0
  maxReplicaCount: 4
  cooldownPeriod: 300          # Wait 5 min before scaling down
  triggers:
  - type: prometheus
    metadata:
      serverAddress: http://prometheus:9090
      metricName: inference_requests
      query: sum(rate(http_requests_total{service="my-llm"}[5m]))
      threshold: '1'           # Scale up on any traffic
```

## Security

### RBAC for ScaledObject/ScaledJob Creation

Anyone who can create a `ScaledObject` or `ScaledJob` in a namespace can trigger arbitrary scaling — including scaling Deployments to hundreds of replicas or creating Jobs that consume GPU resources. Restrict creation to platform admins:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: keda-user
rules:
- apiGroups: ["keda.sh"]
  resources: ["scaledobjects", "scaledjobs", "triggerauthentications"]
  verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "delete"]
```

### IRSA Permissions

The KEDA operator has an IRSA role with permissions to read SQS queue metrics for the GCO job queue. This role is scoped to the specific SQS queue ARN created by the regional stack. The operator does not have broad AWS permissions — it can only read queue attributes for scaling decisions.

If you add custom triggers that access other AWS services (e.g., CloudWatch, Kinesis), you'll need to extend the IRSA role or create a separate `TriggerAuthentication` with its own credentials.

### Namespace Restrictions

The KEDA operator watches all namespaces by default (`watchNamespace: ""`). To restrict it to specific namespaces:

```yaml
keda:
  values:
    watchNamespace: "gco-jobs"  # Only watch gco-jobs namespace
```

This prevents users in other namespaces from creating ScaledObjects that trigger scaling.

## Customization

Edit `lambda/helm-installer/charts.yaml` under `keda`:

```yaml
keda:
  enabled: true   # Set to false to disable
  version: "2.19.0"
  values:
    watchNamespace: ""  # Watch all namespaces
```

To disable the built-in SQS consumer while keeping KEDA, edit `cdk.json`:

```json
"queue_processor": {
  "enabled": false
}
```

## Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete scaledjob sqs-job-processor -n gco-jobs
```
