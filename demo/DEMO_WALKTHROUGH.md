## What You're About to See

GCO (Global Capacity Orchestrator on AWS) is a production-ready platform that lets you submit GPU workloads across any number of AWS regions through a single API. It uses EKS Auto Mode, Global Accelerator, and API Gateway to eliminate the operational complexity of multi-region GPU orchestration.

This document walks through the live demo so you can follow along or replicate it in your own account afterward.

**Repository:** <https://github.com/awslabs/global-capacity-orchestrator-on-aws>

---

## Prerequisites

To replicate this demo, you'll need:

- An AWS account with GPU quota in at least one region
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Python 3.10+, Node.js (LTS), CDK CLI
- A container runtime (Docker, Podman or Finch)

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
python3 --version
cdk --version
```

Install the GCO CLI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/global-capacity-orchestrator-on-aws.git
cd gco
pipx install -e .
gco --version
```

---

## Demo Segment 1: Platform Configuration (~1.5 min)

The entire platform is defined in a single configuration file. Adding a region means adding one line.

**Show the config:**

```bash
cat cdk.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

Key things to notice:

- `deployment_regions.regional` — list of regions where EKS clusters are deployed
- `deployment_regions.global` — where Global Accelerator lives
- `eks_cluster.endpoint_access: PRIVATE` — clusters are private by default
- `job_validation_policy.trusted_registries` — only approved container registries are allowed
- `fsx_lustre.enabled` — toggle for high-performance storage
- `valkey.enabled` — toggle for Valkey Serverless cache

**Show deployed stacks:**

```bash
gco stacks list
gco stacks status gco-us-east-1 --region us-east-1
```

Note: Full deployment takes under 60 minutes via `gco stacks deploy-all -y`. For the demo, infrastructure is pre-deployed.

**Important:** By default, EKS clusters are deployed with `endpoint_access: PRIVATE`, meaning kubectl can only reach the API server from within the VPC. For the demo, we temporarily switch to `PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE` so we can run kubectl from a local machine. To do this before the demo:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json, pathlib
p = pathlib.Path('cdk.json')
c = json.loads(p.read_text())
c['context']['eks_cluster']['endpoint_access'] = 'PUBLIC_AND_PRIVATE'
p.write_text(json.dumps(c, indent=2) + '\n')
"
```

Then redeploy (takes ~5-10 minutes for the endpoint change):

```bash
gco stacks deploy gco-us-east-1 -y
```

In production, keep `PRIVATE` and submit jobs via SQS or API Gateway — no kubectl or cluster access needed.

---

## Demo Segment 2: Capacity Discovery and Job Submission (~3.5 min)

This is the core value proposition — finding GPU capacity and submitting work without managing clusters.

**Check GPU availability:**

```bash
gco capacity check --instance-type g5.xlarge --region us-east-1
gco capacity recommend-region --gpu
```

The CLI checks Spot Placement Scores and instance availability across regions to find where GPUs are actually available right now.

**Look at a GPU job manifest:**

```bash
cat examples/gpu-job.yaml
```

This is a standard Kubernetes Job that requests `nvidia.com/gpu: 1`. Nothing GCO-specific in the manifest — it's portable.

**Submit with automatic region selection:**

```bash
gco jobs submit-sqs examples/gpu-job.yaml --auto-region
```

What just happened: the CLI analyzed capacity across all configured regions, selected the best one, and placed the job manifest on that region's SQS queue. The queue processor — a KEDA ScaledJob running in each cluster — automatically picks up the message and applies the manifest to Kubernetes. No manual intervention needed.

**Verify it was queued and picked up:**

```bash
gco jobs queue-status --all-regions
gco jobs list --region us-east-1
```

**Alternative submission methods:**

GCO supports four ways to submit jobs, depending on your use case:

```bash
# 1. SQS queue (recommended) — async, auto-processed by queue processor
gco jobs submit-sqs examples/gpu-job.yaml --region us-east-1

# 2. API Gateway — synchronous, SigV4 authenticated
gco jobs submit examples/gpu-job.yaml -n gco-jobs

# 3. Direct kubectl — requires EKS access entry
gco jobs submit-direct examples/gpu-job.yaml -r us-east-1

# 4. DynamoDB global queue — centralized tracking with status history
gco jobs submit-queue examples/gpu-job.yaml --region us-east-1
```

---

## Demo Segment 3: Autoscaling in Action (~4 min)

This is where EKS Auto Mode shines. GPU nodes are provisioned on-demand and removed when idle.

**In a second terminal, set up cluster access and watch nodes:**

```bash
./scripts/setup-cluster-access.sh gco-us-east-1 us-east-1
kubectl get nodes -w
```

**Submit a GPU job:**

```bash
gco jobs submit examples/gpu-job.yaml
```

**Watch the pod get scheduled:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n gco-jobs -w
```

What you'll see: EKS Auto Mode detects the pending GPU pod, provisions a g5.xlarge instance (~60-90 seconds), the pod runs `nvidia-smi`, and completes.

**View the job output (run while the pod is still alive or recently completed):**

```bash
gco jobs logs gpu-test-job -n gco-jobs -r us-east-1
```

You should see the `nvidia-smi` output showing the GPU details.

**Watch scale-to-zero:**

Wait ~30 seconds after the job completes, then:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

The GPU node is gone. You only pay for GPU compute while jobs are actually running.

---

## Demo Segment 4: Persistent Storage (~2 min)

When Kubernetes pods terminate, their local data disappears. GCO solves this with shared EFS storage.

**Look at the EFS output job:**

```bash
cat examples/efs-output-job.yaml
```

This job writes results to `/outputs` which is backed by an EFS PersistentVolumeClaim.

**Submit and wait for completion:**

```bash
gco jobs submit examples/efs-output-job.yaml --wait
```

**Download the results — even after the pod is gone:**

```bash
gco files ls -r us-east-1
gco files download efs-output-example ./demo-results -r us-east-1
cat demo-results/results.json
```

The pod terminated, but the data persists on EFS. This is critical for ML training checkpoints and inference results that need to survive job completion.

---

## Demo Segment 5: Inference Endpoints (~3 min)

GCO isn't just for batch jobs — it also manages multi-region inference endpoints with a single command.

**Deploy a vLLM endpoint:**

```bash
gco inference deploy vllm-demo \
  -i vllm/vllm-openai:v0.20.0 \
  --gpu-count 1 \
  --replicas 1 \
  --extra-args '--model' --extra-args 'facebook/opt-125m'
```

Omitting `-r` deploys to all regions so Global Accelerator routing works. The inference_monitor in each region picks up the DynamoDB record and creates the Kubernetes Deployment, Service, and Ingress on the shared ALB.

**Check status and invoke:**

```bash
gco inference status vllm-demo

gco inference invoke vllm-demo \
  -p "Explain GPU orchestration for ML workloads."
```

**Scale and clean up:**

```bash
gco inference scale vllm-demo --replicas 3
gco inference status vllm-demo
gco inference delete vllm-demo -y
```

See the [Inference Walkthrough](INFERENCE_WALKTHROUGH.md) for the full inference demo including canary deployments, autoscaling, model weight management, and more.

---

## Demo Segment 6: Bonus Commands (~2 min)

**AI-powered capacity recommendations (Amazon Bedrock):**

```bash
gco capacity ai-recommend \
  --workload "Training a large language model" \
  --gpu \
  --min-gpus 4
```

**Job templates for reusable workflows:**

```bash
gco templates create examples/gpu-job.yaml \
  --name gpu-training \
  -d "GPU training template"
gco templates list
gco templates run gpu-training --name my-run --region us-east-1
```

**DAG pipelines for multi-step workflows:**

```bash
gco dag run examples/pipeline-dag.yaml --dry-run
gco dag run examples/pipeline-dag.yaml -r us-east-1
```

**Cost tracking:**

```bash
gco costs summary
gco costs regions
gco costs trend --days 7
gco costs workloads
```

**Global job queue (DynamoDB-backed):**

```bash
gco queue list
gco queue stats
```

---

## Demo Segment 7: AWS Trainium and Inferentia (~2 min)

GCO includes built-in support for AWS Trainium and Inferentia accelerators. These are purpose-built ML chips that use the Neuron SDK instead of CUDA, offering lower cost for training and inference workloads.

**Submit a job on Inferentia (cost-optimized inference):**

```bash
gco jobs submit examples/inferentia-job.yaml --region us-east-1
gco jobs get inferentia-test -r us-east-1
gco jobs logs inferentia-test -r us-east-1
```

**Submit a job on Trainium (cost-optimized training):**

```bash
gco jobs submit examples/trainium-job.yaml --region us-east-1
gco jobs get trainium-test -r us-east-1
gco jobs logs trainium-test -r us-east-1
```

**Deploy inference on Neuron accelerators:**

```bash
gco inference deploy my-model \
  -i public.ecr.aws/neuron/your-neuron-image:latest \
  --gpu-count 1 --accelerator neuron
```

*Talking points:*

- Karpenter automatically provisions the right instance type (inf2 for Inferentia, trn1/trn2 for Trainium) based on the node affinity in the manifest
- The `--accelerator neuron` flag on `gco inference deploy` sets up the correct resource requests (`aws.amazon.com/neuron`), tolerations, and node selectors
- A dedicated Neuron nodepool with taints prevents non-Neuron workloads from accidentally scheduling on these instances
- The Neuron device plugin is installed automatically via Helm chart

Each region runs an independent EKS Auto Mode cluster with GPU nodepools, shared storage, health monitoring, SQS job queues with automatic processing, inference endpoint reconciliation, and manifest processing. Adding a region is a one-line config change and a redeploy.

## Key Technical Details

- **Authentication:** IAM-native (SigV4) — uses your existing AWS credentials, no kubeconfig management
- **Compute:** EKS Auto Mode provisions GPU nodes on-demand (g4dn, g5, g5g, p4d, p5) and scales to zero when idle
- **Storage:** EFS for general outputs, FSx for Lustre for high-throughput ML training (optional), Valkey Serverless for caching (optional)
- **Networking:** Global Accelerator provides a single endpoint with automatic failover between regions
- **Job Submission:** Four paths — SQS queue with auto-processing (recommended), API Gateway, direct kubectl, or DynamoDB global queue
- **Queue Processing:** KEDA ScaledJob automatically consumes SQS messages and applies manifests to the cluster — no manual intervention
- **Inference Serving:** DynamoDB-backed desired state with continuous reconciliation, canary deployments, autoscaling, and model weight sync from S3
- **Compliance:** CDK-nag validated against HIPAA, NIST 800-53, PCI DSS
- **Cost Tracking:** Built-in cost breakdown by service, region, and workload with forecasting
