# MCP Tools

MCP tool definitions — one file per domain. Each module registers tools against the shared FastMCP server instance via `@mcp.tool()` decorators.

## Table of Contents

## Files

Counts are tools registered per module; tools gated behind a feature flag only
appear when that flag (or the umbrella `GCO_ENABLE_ALL_TOOLS`) is set. At
default registration the server exposes 139 tools; with every flag enabled the
ceiling is 196. See [Feature Flags](../README.md#feature-flags) for the
flag-to-tool mapping.

## Tool Reference

Every registered MCP tool, grouped by module, with a one-line description from the tool docstring. Tools marked `(gated)` in the [Files](#files) table register only when their feature flag (or the umbrella `GCO_ENABLE_ALL_TOOLS`) is set; this reference lists the full set. `tests/test_docs_coverage.py` fails if a registered tool is missing from this section.

### `jobs.py`

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cluster_health` | Get health status of GCO clusters. |
| `delete_job` | Delete a job. |
| `get_job` | Get details of a specific job, including the node its pods landed on and that node's instance type and spot/on-demand capacity type. |
| `get_job_events` | Get Kubernetes events for a job (useful for debugging). |
| `get_job_logs` | Get logs from a job. |
| `get_job_metrics` | Get CPU and memory usage for all pods in a job. |
| `get_job_pods` | Get pod details, placement, and container status for a job. Each pod carries the instance type and capacity type of the node it landed on. |

Evaluates the manifest against each region's deployed policy using the manifest processor's own checks; any field differing across regions means a region was deployed from a different `cdk.json` checkout. `offline=True` reads `cdk.json` with no AWS calls, reporting the configured rather than deployed policy.

## How Tools Work

Every tool follows the same pattern:

1. Decorated with `@mcp.tool()` (registers with FastMCP) and `@audit_logged` (structured audit logging)
2. Builds a CLI argument list from the tool's parameters
3. Calls `cli_runner._run_cli(*args)` which shells out to `gco --output json ...`
4. Returns the JSON string result to the LLM

Most tools follow this `_run_cli` shell-out pattern. A few domains — notably the
image-registry and image-mirror tools in `images.py` — instead wrap their CLI
manager/core directly via `asyncio.to_thread(...)` (e.g. `cli.images.ImageManager`,
`cli._image_mirror`), so the MCP layer never re-implements the underlying
ECR/runtime logic. They still carry `@mcp.tool()` + `@audit_logged` and return a
JSON string. The image-mirror tools (`images_mirror_plan`, `images_mirror_status`,
`images_mirror`) are documented in [Image Mirror](../../docs/IMAGE_MIRROR.md#mcp-tools).

## Adding a New Tool

1. Add the function to the appropriate domain file (or create a new one)
2. Decorate with `@mcp.tool()` and `@audit_logged`
3. Call `cli_runner._run_cli(...)` with the correct CLI arguments
4. Register the module in `tools/__init__.py` if it's a new file
5. Add tests in `tests/test_mcp_server.py` and `tests/test_mcp_integration.py`
