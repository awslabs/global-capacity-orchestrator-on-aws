## Examples

### Aurora pgvector Job

**File:** `aurora-pgvector-job.yaml`

Connects to the regional Aurora Serverless v2 PostgreSQL cluster with pgvector for vector similarity search (RAG, semantic search). Credentials are injected automatically via the `gco-aurora-pgvector` ConfigMap and AWS Secrets Manager.

**Prerequisites:** Enable Aurora in `cdk.json`: `"aurora_pgvector": { "enabled": true }` and redeploy.

**Usage:**
```bash
gco jobs submit-direct examples/aurora-pgvector-job.yaml -r us-east-1
```

**Demonstrates:** pgvector extension setup, HNSW index creation, vector similarity search, embedding storage and retrieval.

**When to use:** RAG applications, semantic search, vector similarity workloads, storing and querying embeddings.

---

### DAG Pipeline

**Files:** `pipeline-dag.yaml`, `dag-step-preprocess.yaml`, `dag-step-train.yaml`

A multi-step pipeline with dependency ordering. The preprocess step generates training data on shared EFS, then the train step reads it and produces model artifacts. Steps only run after their dependencies complete successfully.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Validate the DAG
gco dag validate examples/pipeline-dag.yaml

# Dry run (shows execution plan without running)
gco dag run examples/pipeline-dag.yaml --dry-run

# Run the pipeline
gco dag run examples/pipeline-dag.yaml -r us-east-1
```

**When to use:** Multi-step ML pipelines, data processing workflows with dependencies, any workload where steps must execute in order.

---

### EFA Distributed Training

**File:** `efa-distributed-training.yaml`

Uses Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) for high-bandwidth inter-node communication — up to 3.2 Tbps on P5/Trn2 instances and up to 28.8 Tbps on P6e-GB200 UltraServers. Critical for large-scale distributed training.

**Usage:**
```bash
gco jobs submit-direct examples/efa-distributed-training.yaml -r us-east-1
```

**Requirements:** EFA-capable instances (p4d.24xlarge, p5.48xlarge, p5e.48xlarge, p6, trn1.32xlarge, trn2.48xlarge). EFA is enabled by default via the NVIDIA Network Operator Helm chart.

**When to use:** Large-scale distributed training requiring high inter-node bandwidth, NCCL-based multi-node GPU communication.

---

### EFS Output Job

**File:** `efs-output-job.yaml`

Writes output to shared EFS storage, demonstrating how to persist job results that survive pod termination.

**Usage:**
```bash
gco jobs submit-direct examples/efs-output-job.yaml --region us-east-1 -n gco-jobs
gco files ls -r us-east-1
gco files download efs-output-example ./efs-results -r us-east-1
cat ./efs-results/results.json
```

**Features:** Mounts shared EFS at `/outputs`, creates output directory using job name, results persist after job completion, other pods can read the outputs.

**When to use:** ML training with checkpoint saving, data processing pipelines, sharing data between jobs.

---

### FSx for Lustre Job

**File:** `fsx-lustre-job.yaml`

Uses FSx for Lustre high-performance parallel storage for I/O-intensive workloads.

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
gco stacks fsx enable -y
gco stacks deploy gco-us-east-1 -y
```

**Usage:**
```bash
gco jobs submit-direct examples/fsx-lustre-job.yaml --region us-east-1 -n gco-jobs
gco files download fsx-lustre-example ./fsx-results -r us-east-1 -t fsx
```

**FSx vs EFS:**

| Feature | EFS | FSx for Lustre |
|---------|-----|----------------|
| Throughput | Up to 10 GB/s | Up to 1000+ GB/s |
| Latency | ~1-3ms | ~sub-ms |
| Cost | Pay per GB stored | Pay per GB provisioned |
| Best for | General purpose | HPC, ML training |

**When to use:** Large-scale ML training with big datasets, HPC workloads, jobs requiring high I/O throughput, checkpoint/restart for long-running jobs.

---

### GPU Job

**File:** `gpu-job.yaml`

A job that requests GPU resources and runs on GPU-enabled nodes.

**Usage:**
```bash
gco jobs submit-sqs examples/gpu-job.yaml --region us-east-1
kubectl logs job/gpu-test-job
```

**Requirements:** GPU nodepools (included by default), NVIDIA device plugin (included by default).

**When to use:** ML model training, GPU-accelerated workloads, testing GPU availability.

---

### GPU Time-Slicing Job

**File:** `gpu-timeslicing-job.yaml`

Uses a fractional GPU via NVIDIA time-slicing. Multiple pods share a single physical GPU by taking turns, letting you run lightweight GPU workloads without dedicating a full GPU to each pod.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/gpu-timeslicing-job.yaml
kubectl logs job/gpu-timeslice-job -n gco-jobs
```

**Requirements:** GPU nodepools (default), NVIDIA device plugin with time-slicing ConfigMap applied (not enabled by default — see manifest comments for setup).

**When to use:** Inference workloads that don't need a full GPU, dev/test GPU workloads, reducing GPU costs by sharing hardware.

---

### Inference Frameworks

GCO includes example manifests for multiple inference frameworks. Each creates a Deployment and Service in the `gco-inference` namespace.

| Example | Framework | Description | Docs |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------|
| `inference-sglang.yaml` | SGLang | High-throughput serving with RadixAttention | [Inference Guide](../docs/INFERENCE.md) |
| `inference-tgi.yaml` | TGI | HuggingFace optimized inference | [Inference Guide](../docs/INFERENCE.md) |
| `inference-torchserve.yaml` | TorchServe | PyTorch model serving | [Inference Guide](../docs/INFERENCE.md) |
| `inference-triton.yaml` | Triton | NVIDIA multi-framework serving (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX) | [Inference Guide](../docs/INFERENCE.md) |
| `inference-vllm.yaml` | vLLM | OpenAI-compatible LLM serving with PagedAttention | [Inference Guide](../docs/INFERENCE.md) |

**Deploy via CLI (recommended for multi-region):**
```bash
gco inference deploy my-llm -i vllm/vllm-openai:v0.20.0 --gpu-count 1
```

**Deploy a manifest directly (single region):**
```bash
gco jobs submit-direct examples/inference-vllm.yaml -r us-east-1
```

See the [Inference Guide](../docs/INFERENCE.md) for canary deployments, scaling, health checks, and multi-region routing.

---

### Inferentia Job

**File:** `inferentia-job.yaml`

Runs on an AWS Inferentia2 instance using the Neuron SDK. Inferentia is optimized for low-cost, high-throughput inference.

**Usage:**

---

### KEDA Autoscaled Job

**File:** `keda-scaled-job.yaml`

A custom SQS-triggered ScaledJob using KEDA. Scales job replicas based on SQS queue depth. Note: GCO ships with a built-in SQS consumer — use this example as a starting point for custom SQS-triggered workloads.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Edit the manifest to set your JOB_QUEUE_URL and REGION, then:
kubectl apply -f examples/keda-scaled-job.yaml
```

**Requirements:** KEDA (enabled by default). See [KEDA docs](../docs/KEDA.md).

**When to use:** Custom SQS-triggered processing, event-driven autoscaling, scaling workloads based on external metrics.

---

### Kueue Job Queueing

**File:** `kueue-job.yaml`

Demonstrates job queueing with resource quotas and fair-sharing. Creates ClusterQueue, LocalQueue, ResourceFlavors, and sample CPU + GPU jobs. Jobs are queued and scheduled based on available cluster resources.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/kueue-job.yaml
kubectl get clusterqueue
kubectl get localqueue -n gco-jobs
kubectl get workloads -n gco-jobs
```

**Requirements:** Kueue (enabled by default). See [Kueue docs](../docs/KUEUE.md).

**When to use:** Multi-tenant clusters with resource quotas, fair-sharing between teams, priority-based job scheduling.

---

### MegaTrain SFT Job

**File:** `megatrain-sft-job.yaml`

Runs SFT fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-1.5B on a single GPU using [MegaTrain](https://github.com/DLYuanGod/MegaTrain). An init container downloads model weights to shared EFS (skipped if already cached), then the main container trains on the built-in alpaca demo dataset. Change the `MODEL_NAME` env var to target a different HuggingFace model.

**Usage:**
```bash
gco jobs submit-direct examples/megatrain-sft-job.yaml -r us-east-1
gco jobs logs megatrain-sft -r us-east-1 -f
```

**Requirements:** GPU node with large CPU RAM, shared EFS storage.

**When to use:** SFT fine-tuning of large HuggingFace models, full-precision training on a single GPU.

---

### Model Download Job

**File:** `model-download-job.yaml`

Pre-downloads model weights from HuggingFace to shared EFS so inference endpoints can mount them instantly. Downloads `facebook/opt-125m` by default — change the `MODEL_ID` env var for other models. For gated models (Llama, Mistral), uncomment the `HF_TOKEN` env var.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/model-download-job.yaml
# After completion, deploy inference with the cached model:
gco inference deploy my-model -i vllm/vllm-openai:v0.20.0 --model-path /models/opt-125m
```

**When to use:** Pre-caching model weights before inference deployment, avoiding repeated downloads across pods.

---

### Multi-GPU Distributed Training

**File:** `multi-gpu-training.yaml`

Distributed training across multiple GPUs using PyTorch DistributedDataParallel (DDP). Creates indexed pods with a headless service for DNS-based peer discovery.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/multi-gpu-training.yaml
kubectl get pods -n gco-jobs -l job-name=pytorch-ddp-training
kubectl logs -f job/pytorch-ddp-training -n gco-jobs
```

**When to use:** Multi-node distributed training, PyTorch DDP workloads, scaling training across GPUs.

---

### Ray Cluster

**File:** `ray-cluster.yaml`

Creates a Ray cluster for distributed computing — training, hyperparameter tuning, and model serving. Includes a head node and auto-scaling CPU worker group (1–5 replicas).

**Usage:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/ray-cluster.yaml
kubectl get raycluster -n gco-jobs
# Port-forward to Ray dashboard:
kubectl port-forward svc/ray-cluster-head-svc 8265:8265 -n gco-jobs
# Submit a Ray job:
ray job submit --address http://localhost:8265 -- python -c "import ray; ray.init(); print(ray.cluster_resources())"
```

**Requirements:** KubeRay operator (enabled by default). See [KubeRay docs](../docs/KUBERAY.md).

**When to use:** Distributed training, hyperparameter tuning, Ray Serve for model serving, any workload using the Ray framework.

---

### Simple Job

**File:** `simple-job.yaml`

A basic Kubernetes Job that runs a simple command and completes. Start here to verify your cluster is working.

**Usage:**
```bash
gco jobs submit-sqs examples/simple-job.yaml --region us-east-1
# or directly:
kubectl apply -f examples/simple-job.yaml
kubectl logs job/hello-gco
```

**When to use:** Testing cluster connectivity, running one-off tasks, batch processing.

---

### Slurm Cluster Job

**File:** `slurm-cluster-job.yaml`

A self-contained Kubernetes Job that writes a Slurm batch script into the login pod, submits it via `sbatch`, waits for completion, and prints the output.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/slurm-cluster-job.yaml
kubectl logs job/slurm-test -n gco-jobs -f
```

**Requirements:** Slinky Slurm Operator + Slurm cluster (opt-in — enable in `cdk.json`: `"helm": { "slurm": { "enabled": true } }`), cert-manager (installed by default). See [Slurm docs](../docs/SLURM_OPERATOR.md).

**When to use:** HPC workloads needing Slurm's deterministic scheduling, teams migrating from on-premises Slurm clusters.

---

### SQS Job Submission

**File:** `sqs-job-submission.yaml`

Demonstrates the recommended SQS-based submission path. Contains two example jobs (CPU and GPU) that you submit via the SQS queue. The built-in KEDA consumer automatically picks up messages and applies manifests to the cluster.

**Usage:**
```bash
gco jobs submit-sqs examples/sqs-job-submission.yaml --region us-east-1
gco jobs submit-sqs examples/sqs-job-submission.yaml --auto-region
gco jobs submit-sqs examples/sqs-job-submission.yaml --priority 10
```

**Why SQS:** Decoupled (returns immediately), fault-tolerant (DLQ after 3 retries), auto-scaling (KEDA scales consumers based on queue depth), priority support.

---

### Trainium Job

**File:** `trainium-job.yaml`

Runs on an AWS Trainium instance using the Neuron SDK. Trainium is a purpose-built ML accelerator designed by AWS, offering lower cost than GPU instances for training workloads.

**Usage:**

---

### Valkey Cache Job

**File:** `valkey-cache-job.yaml`

Connects to the regional Valkey Serverless cache for K/V caching, session state, or feature stores. The Valkey endpoint is injected automatically via the `gco-valkey` ConfigMap — the same manifest works in any region.

**Prerequisites:** Enable Valkey in `cdk.json`: `"valkey": { "enabled": true }` and redeploy.

**Usage:**
```bash
gco jobs submit-direct examples/valkey-cache-job.yaml -r us-east-1
```

**Demonstrates:** Prompt caching, feature embedding storage, session state management, TTL-based expiry.

**When to use:** LLM prompt caching, feature stores, session state, any workload needing low-latency key-value access.

---

### Volcano Gang Scheduling

**File:** `volcano-gang-job.yaml`

Demonstrates gang scheduling for distributed training — all pods must be scheduled together or none at all. Creates a master + 2 workers with automatic restart policies.

**Usage:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/volcano-gang-job.yaml
kubectl get vcjob -n gco-jobs
kubectl get pods -n gco-jobs -l volcano.sh/job-name=distributed-training
```

**When to use:** Multi-tenant clusters with competing teams, hierarchical resource quota management, fair-sharing with preemption.

For a detailed comparison of all schedulers, see the [Schedulers Overview](../docs/SCHEDULERS.md).

---

## Customizing Examples

### Changing Resource Requests/Limits

Edit the `resources` section:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"      # Increase CPU request
    memory: "256Mi"  # Increase memory request
  limits:
    cpu: "1000m"     # Increase CPU limit
    memory: "1Gi"    # Increase memory limit
```

### Changing Replica Count

Edit the `replicas` field in Deployments:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 5  # Increase from 3 to 5
```

### Adding Environment Variables

Add to the container spec:

```yaml
containers:
- name: my-app
  image: my-image
  env:
  - name: MY_VAR
    value: "my-value"
  - name: CLUSTER_NAME
    value: "gco-us-east-1"
```

### Using ConfigMaps and Secrets

```yaml
# Create ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  config.json: |
    {"key": "value"}

---
# Use in Pod
containers:
- name: my-app
  volumeMounts:
  - name: config
    mountPath: /etc/config
volumes:
- name: config
  configMap:
    name: app-config
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Set Resource Limits

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "128Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"
```

This helps Kubernetes schedule pods efficiently and prevents resource exhaustion.

### 2. Use Security Contexts

```yaml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
```

This follows security best practices and reduces attack surface.

### 3. Add Labels

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    app: my-app
    version: v1.0
    environment: production
```

Labels help with organization, selection, and monitoring.

### 4. Use Namespaces

```yaml
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
```

Namespaces provide isolation and organization.

### 5. Set Restart Policies

For Jobs:
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never  # or OnFailure
```

For Deployments:
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Always  # default
```

### 6. Prevent Node Consolidation for Long-Running Jobs

EKS Auto Mode (Karpenter) may consolidate underutilized nodes, which evicts running pods. For training jobs or other long-running workloads that should not be interrupted, add the `karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt` annotation to the pod template:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt: "true"
```

This tells the autoscaler to leave the node alone until the pod completes. Remove the annotation or omit it for short-lived jobs where eviction and retry is acceptable.

## Troubleshooting

### "Resource limits exceed maximum allowed values"

The GCO API validates manifest resource requests against configurable limits. If your job needs more CPU, memory, or GPUs than the defaults allow, update the limits in `cdk.json` and redeploy:

```json
{
  "manifest_processor": {
    "resource_quotas": {
      "max_cpu_per_manifest": "96",
      "max_memory_per_manifest": "192Gi",
      "max_gpu_per_manifest": 8
    }
  },
  "queue_processor": {
    "max_cpu_per_manifest": "96",
    "max_memory_per_manifest": "192Gi",
    "max_gpu_per_manifest": 8
  }
}
```

Then redeploy: `gco stacks deploy-all -y`

Both sections control independent submission paths — `manifest_processor` validates jobs submitted via the API Gateway, and `queue_processor` validates jobs submitted via SQS. Update whichever path you use, or both if you use both.

## Testing Your Manifests

### Dry Run

Test without actually creating resources:

```bash
kubectl apply -f your-manifest.yaml --dry-run=client
```

### Validate

Check for syntax errors:

```bash
kubectl apply -f your-manifest.yaml --validate=true --dry-run=server
```

### Check Status

After applying:

```bash
# Check pods
kubectl get pods -w

# Check events
kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# Describe resource
kubectl describe pod POD-NAME
```

## Cleaning Up

Delete resources created by examples:

```bash
# Delete specific resource
kubectl delete -f examples/simple-job.yaml

# Delete all jobs
kubectl delete jobs --all

# Delete all resources in a namespace
kubectl delete all --all -n default
```
