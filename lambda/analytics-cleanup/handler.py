"""Analytics stack cleanup handler.

Runs as a CloudFormation custom resource on stack deletion. Removes all
SageMaker apps, spaces and user profiles from the Studio domain (waiting
for each to fully drain) and all EFS access points from the Studio file
system so CloudFormation can delete the domain and EFS cleanly.

If draining apps/spaces/user-profiles fails, the handler raises — this
fails the custom resource and stops CloudFormation before it tries (and
fails) to delete the domain. EFS/security-group cleanup errors are
logged but non-fatal.

Environment variables:
    DOMAIN_ID: SageMaker Studio domain ID
    EFS_ID: EFS file system ID

# These constants govern how aggressively we poll SageMaker/EFS while waiting
# for asynchronous delete operations to drain. The defaults are sized for the
# worst case we've observed in production (a domain with a handful of users,
# one JupyterLab app each). If you see timeouts in CloudWatch, raise the
# ``*_WAIT_SECONDS`` values — and correspondingly bump ``timeout=`` on the
# ``CleanupFunction`` in ``gco/stacks/analytics_stack.py`` so the Lambda
# doesn't exceed its own execution timeout.
#
# Lower the values if you want the custom resource to fail fast during
# local testing, but remember that CloudFormation will then hit the domain
# delete before the async drains finish and fail with
# ``Unable to delete Domain ... because UserProfile(s) are associated``.

# Interval between list-and-check iterations of every drain wait loop.
# Small enough to keep typical stacks responsive, large enough to avoid
# throttling SageMaker/EFS control-plane APIs.
