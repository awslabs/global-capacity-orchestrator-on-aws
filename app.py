GCO (Global Capacity Orchestrator on AWS) - Multi-Region EKS Auto Mode Platform for AI/ML Workloads

This is the main CDK application entry point that orchestrates the deployment of:
- Global Stack: AWS Global Accelerator for multi-region routing
- API Gateway Stack: Centralized IAM-authenticated entry point
- Regional Stacks: EKS clusters, ALBs, and services per region
- Monitoring Stack: Cross-region CloudWatch dashboards and alarms

Architecture:
    User → API Gateway (IAM Auth) → Global Accelerator → Regional ALB → EKS Services

Usage:
    cdk deploy --all                    # Deploy all stacks
    cdk deploy gco-us-east-1            # Deploy single region
    cdk destroy --all                   # Cleanup all resources
